## Database Setup

The Linear Planning Agent uses both PostgreSQL and SQLite databases:

- **PostgreSQL**: For storing Linear and Confluence tokens, planning sessions, and other application data.
- **SQLite**: For storing synchronization state, including the last synchronization timestamp and conflicts.

### PostgreSQL Setup

1. **Using Docker**:
   - The PostgreSQL database is included in the Docker Compose configuration.
   - No additional setup is required if you're using Docker.

2. **Using a Separate PostgreSQL Instance**:
   - If you're using a separate PostgreSQL instance, create a new database:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE linear_agent;
     CREATE USER linear_agent WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';
     GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE linear_agent TO linear_agent;
     ```
   - Update the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable with your PostgreSQL connection string.

### SQLite Setup

1. **Using Docker**:
   - The SQLite database is stored in a Docker volume.
   - No additional setup is required if you're using Docker.

2. **Using Local Development**:
   - Create a `data` directory in the root of the project:
     ```bash
     mkdir -p data
     ```
   - Update the `SQLITE_DB_PATH` environment variable with the path to your SQLite database file.

LINEAR_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
LINEAR_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
LINEAR_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-domain.com/auth/callback

# Webhook Configuration
WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret

# Confluence OAuth Application Credentials
CONFLUENCE_CLIENT_ID=your_confluence_client_id
CONFLUENCE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_confluence_client_secret

# Application Configuration for OAuth
APP_URL=https://your-domain.com

# Session Management
SESSION_SECRET=generate_a_random_session_secret_at_least_32_chars

# Legacy Confluence API Credentials (for backward compatibility)
CONFLUENCE_USERNAME=your_atlassian_email
CONFLUENCE_API_TOKEN=your_api_token
CONFLUENCE_BASE_URL=https://your-domain.atlassian.net/wiki

# Database Configuration

### Environment Variable Descriptions

#### OAuth Configuration
- **CONFLUENCE_CLIENT_ID**: Client ID from your Confluence OAuth application
- **CONFLUENCE_CLIENT_SECRET**: Client Secret from your Confluence OAuth application
- **APP_URL**: The base URL of your application (used for OAuth callback construction)
- **SESSION_SECRET**: A random string at least 32 characters long for session management

#### Security Best Practices
- **Session Secret Generation**: Use a cryptographically secure random string generator:
  ```bash
  # Generate a secure session secret
  openssl rand -base64 32
  ```
- **Environment Security**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- **Production Configuration**: Use HTTPS URLs for all OAuth callbacks in production
- **Credential Management**: Store OAuth credentials securely and rotate them regularly

### OAuth Setup Validation

To validate your OAuth configuration:

1. **Check Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   # Verify all required OAuth variables are set
   grep -E "(CONFLUENCE_CLIENT_ID|CONFLUENCE_CLIENT_SECRET|APP_URL|SESSION_SECRET)" .env
   ```

2. **Test OAuth Flow**:
   - Start your application
   - Navigate to `/auth/confluence` to test Confluence OAuth
   - Verify successful authentication and callback handling

3. **Validate Callback URLs**:
   - Ensure your OAuth application callback URLs match your `APP_URL` configuration
   - Test both local development and production URLs

## Testing the Integration

After setting up the Linear Planning Agent, you can test it by following these steps:

1. **Authenticate with Linear**:
   - Open your browser and navigate to `https://your-domain.com/auth` or `http://localhost:3000/auth` for local development.
   - You'll be redirected to Linear to authorize the application.
   - After authorization, you'll be redirected back to your application.

2. **Parse Confluence Page**:
   - Use the planning agent to parse your Confluence page:
     ```bash
     ./scripts/start-planning-agent.sh "https://your-domain.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SPACE/pages/123456789" "Project Planning"
     ```
   - Check the logs to see if the page was parsed successfully.

3. **Test Webhook**:
   - Create or update an issue in Linear.
   - Check the logs of your application to see if the webhook event was received.

4. **Test Synchronization**:
   - Use the synchronization CLI to start synchronization:
     ```bash
     npm run sync:start -- --org-id=your-organization-id --team-id=your-linear-team-id --page-id=your-confluence-page-id
     ```
   - Check the logs to see if the synchronization is working correctly.
