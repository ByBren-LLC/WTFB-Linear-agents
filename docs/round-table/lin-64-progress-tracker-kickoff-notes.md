# LIN-64 Progress Tracker Business Logic Refinement - Kickoff Notes

**Date**: July 6, 2025  
**Issue**: [LIN-64](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/issue/LIN-64/progress-tracker-business-logic-refinement)  
**Assignee**: Claude  
**Story Points**: 2  
**Priority**: Medium - Edge case resolution  
**Cycle**: Cycle 3 (Parallel execution with LIN-66 documentation)

## üéØ **MISSION OVERVIEW**

### **Primary Objective**
Resolve business logic questions and edge cases identified during LIN-60 Enhanced Response System implementation for the Progress Tracker component.

### **Context**
During LIN-60 implementation, several business logic questions arose regarding Progress Tracker behavior in edge cases. These need resolution to ensure production-ready reliability.

### **Business Impact**
- **Production Readiness**: Resolve edge cases for reliable operation
- **User Experience**: Ensure consistent progress tracking behavior
- **System Reliability**: Handle all scenarios gracefully
- **Technical Debt**: Clear outstanding implementation questions

---

## üìã **IDENTIFIED EDGE CASES & BUSINESS LOGIC QUESTIONS**

### **1. Progress Calculation Edge Cases**
**Question**: How should progress be calculated when:
- Stories have 0 points assigned?
- Stories are moved between iterations mid-cycle?
- Parent epics have mixed completion states?

**Current Behavior**: Needs clarification and consistent handling

### **2. Threshold Configuration**
**Question**: What are the correct business thresholds for:
- ART readiness percentage warnings?
- Progress tracking alert levels?
- Capacity utilization boundaries?

**Current Implementation**: Uses placeholder values that need business validation

### **3. Linear Integration Specifics**
**Question**: How should the system handle:
- Linear API rate limiting during progress updates?
- Webhook delays affecting real-time progress tracking?
- Concurrent updates from multiple team members?

**Current Behavior**: Basic handling that needs edge case refinement

### **4. State Transition Logic**
**Question**: What should happen when:
- Issues are moved to "Done" but parent epic remains "In Progress"?
- Dependencies are completed out of order?
- Team capacity changes mid-iteration?

**Current Implementation**: Needs consistent business rules

## üîç **TECHNICAL INVESTIGATION AREAS**

### **Progress Tracker Component Analysis**
```typescript
// Areas requiring business logic clarification
src/agent/progress-tracker.ts
- calculateProgress() method edge cases
- updateProgressMetrics() threshold handling
- handleStateTransition() business rules
```

### **Integration Points**
- **Linear API**: Progress update patterns and error handling
- **Enhanced Response System**: Progress formatting and display
- **Monitoring System**: Alert thresholds and notification triggers

### **Configuration Requirements**
- Business threshold values
- Error handling strategies
- Fallback behaviors for edge cases

---

## üöÄ **IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH**

### **Phase 1: Business Logic Analysis** (Day 1)
1. **Review LIN-60 implementation** for identified edge cases
2. **Analyze current Progress Tracker** behavior and gaps
3. **Document specific business questions** requiring resolution
4. **Propose business rules** for each edge case scenario

### **Phase 2: Technical Resolution** (Day 2)
1. **Implement business logic fixes** for identified edge cases
2. **Add configuration options** for business thresholds
3. **Enhance error handling** for integration points
4. **Update documentation** with business rules

### **Phase 3: Validation & Testing** (Day 3)
1. **Test edge case scenarios** with new business logic
2. **Validate integration behavior** under various conditions
3. **Document configuration options** and their impacts
4. **Ensure production readiness** with comprehensive testing

---

## üìä **DELIVERABLES**

### **Primary Deliverables**
1. **Business Logic Documentation**: Clear rules for all edge cases
2. **Code Implementation**: Robust handling of identified scenarios
3. **Configuration Guide**: Business threshold documentation
4. **Test Coverage**: Edge case validation and integration testing

### **Supporting Documentation**
- Business rule definitions and rationale
- Configuration option explanations
- Integration pattern documentation
- Edge case handling examples

---

## üîó **INTEGRATION CONSIDERATIONS**

### **LIN-60 Enhanced Response System**
- Progress formatting must handle edge case scenarios
- Error messages should be user-friendly and actionable
- Response templates need edge case variations

### **LIN-66 Documentation Overhaul**
- Business logic decisions should be documented
- Configuration options need clear explanations
- Edge case handling should be included in troubleshooting

### **Production Operations**
- Monitoring should alert on edge case occurrences
- Logging should capture business logic decisions
- Configuration should be environment-specific

---

## üèõÔ∏è **ARCHITECTURAL CONSIDERATIONS**

### **Business Rule Engine**
Consider implementing a configurable business rule engine for:
- Progress calculation algorithms
- Threshold management
- State transition logic

### **Configuration Management**
Externalize business logic configuration for:
- Environment-specific thresholds
- Feature flags for edge case handling
- A/B testing of business rules

### **Monitoring & Observability**
Implement comprehensive monitoring for:
- Edge case occurrence frequency
- Business rule execution patterns
- Performance impact of logic changes

**This kickoff establishes the foundation for resolving Progress Tracker business logic questions and ensuring production-ready edge case handling.**
