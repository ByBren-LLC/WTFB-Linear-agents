# Kick-off: Linear SDK v2.6.0 Compatibility Fixes (LIN-72)

**Document Type:** Remote Agent Kickoff Notes
**Author:** Auggie III, ARCHitect-in-the-IDE
**Date:** July 8, 2025
**Agent Assignment:** Remote Agent #3
**Priority:** HIGH - SDK compatibility

## Assignment Overview

You are assigned to fix Linear SDK v2.6.0 compatibility issues including property access pattern updates. This is part of a coordinated 4-agent effort to restore TypeScript strict mode compliance.

## Linear Project Information

- **Linear Issue**: [LIN-72](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/issue/LIN-72/linear-sdk-v260-compatibility-fixes)
- **Parent Issue**: [LIN-44](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/issue/LIN-44/complete-jest-infrastructure-agent-process-improvements)
- **Linear Team**: [Linear agents](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/team/LIN)
- **Priority**: High (2)
- **Story Points**: 2
- **Labels**: technical-debt, api-integration

## Linear Issue Creation

As part of this task, you should:
1. âœ… Issue already created: [LIN-72](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/issue/LIN-72)
2. Update the issue status to "In Progress" when you begin
3. Add progress comments as you work
4. Set to "In Review" when PR is submitted

## Implementation Document

Your detailed implementation document is available in the repository:
[specs/implementation_docs/lin-72-linear-sdk-compatibility-implementation.md](../specs/implementation_docs/lin-72-linear-sdk-compatibility-implementation.md)

## Project Context

This task is part of a coordinated 4-agent effort to restore TypeScript strict mode compliance. You will work in parallel with 2 other Remote Agents after the ARCHitect completes the foundation Jest infrastructure fixes (LIN-70).

Your task focuses on Linear SDK v2.6.0 compatibility including:
- Updating property access patterns (parentId vs parent, cycleId vs cycle)
- Ensuring correct Linear API response handling
- Fixing SDK integration patterns

## Key Responsibilities

1. **Update property access patterns** for Linear SDK v2.6.0
2. **Fix parentId vs parent** property access issues
3. **Update cycleId vs cycle** property access patterns
4. **Ensure correct response handling** for Linear API calls
5. **Validate SDK integration** patterns
6. **Test Linear API compatibility** in affected files
7. Write comprehensive tests for all components
8. Document the API with JSDoc comments

## Existing Codebase Context

The following files are relevant to your task:
- `src/linear/client.ts`: Linear API client wrapper
- `src/linear/types.ts`: Linear type definitions
- Files using Linear SDK with property access issues
- Any integration files with Linear API calls

## Definition of Done

Your task will be considered complete when:
- All property access patterns updated for SDK v2.6.0
- parentId vs parent issues resolved
- cycleId vs cycle issues resolved
- Linear API response handling is correct
- Clean TypeScript compilation in your file scope
- All existing tests still pass
- Linear API integration tests pass
- Code is well-documented with JSDoc comments
- Tests are comprehensive and passing
- Pull request is submitted and approved

## Branching and PR Guidelines

- Create a branch named `fix/linear-sdk-v2-6-0-compatibility`
- Make your changes in this branch
- Submit a PR to the `dev` branch when complete
- Include a detailed description of your changes in the PR

## Timeline

- Estimated effort: 2 story points
- Expected completion: Within 1-2 hours
- **Dependency**: Wait for LIN-70 completion before starting

## Communication

- Update progress in Linear issue LIN-72
- Provide regular updates on your progress
- Flag any blockers or dependencies as soon as possible
- Coordinate with ARCHitect for any architectural questions

## Dependencies

**Upstream**: LIN-70 (Jest Mock Infrastructure) must complete first
**Parallel**: LIN-71 (SAFe Models) and LIN-73 (Property Definitions)
**Downstream**: None - isolated scope

## Coordination Notes

- **Wait for LIN-70 completion** before starting your work
- Your scope is isolated from other agents to prevent conflicts
- ARCHitect will coordinate any integration issues
- Focus only on Linear SDK compatibility issues in your assigned files

## Linear SDK v2.6.0 Key Changes

### Property Access Pattern Changes

**Before (v2.5.x)**:
```typescript
const parentId = issue.parentId;
const cycleId = issue.cycleId;
```

**After (v2.6.0)**:
```typescript
const parentId = issue.parent?.id;
const cycleId = issue.cycle?.id;
```

### Response Pattern Changes

**Before**:
```typescript
const response = await this.linearClient.issueCreate(issueData);
if (response.error) {
  throw new Error(`Failed to create issue: ${response.error}`);
}
const issueId = response.issue.id;
```

**After**:
```typescript
const response = await this.linearClient.issueCreate(issueData);
if (!response.success) {
  throw new Error('Failed to create issue');
}
const issueId = response.issue.id;
```

Thank you for your contribution to the TypeScript strict mode compliance effort. Your work on Linear SDK compatibility is essential for maintaining our Linear API integration.

The ARCHitect will be available to answer questions and provide guidance throughout the implementation process.
