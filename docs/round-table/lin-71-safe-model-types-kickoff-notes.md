# Kick-off: SAFe Model Type Completeness Fixes (LIN-71)

**Document Type:** Remote Agent Kickoff Notes
**Author:** Auggie III, ARCHitect-in-the-IDE
**Date:** July 8, 2025
**Agent Assignment:** Remote Agent #2
**Priority:** HIGH - Type safety

## Assignment Overview

You are assigned to fix SAFe model type completeness issues including enum mismatches and missing required properties. This is part of a coordinated 4-agent effort to restore TypeScript strict mode compliance.

## Linear Project Information

- **Linear Issue**: [LIN-71](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/issue/LIN-71/safe-model-type-completeness-fixes)
- **Parent Issue**: [LIN-44](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/issue/LIN-44/complete-jest-infrastructure-agent-process-improvements)
- **Linear Team**: [Linear agents](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/team/LIN)
- **Priority**: High (2)
- **Story Points**: 3
- **Labels**: technical-debt, safe

## Linear Issue Creation

As part of this task, you should:
1. âœ… Issue already created: [LIN-71](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/issue/LIN-71)
2. Update the issue status to "In Progress" when you begin
3. Add progress comments as you work
4. Set to "In Review" when PR is submitted

## Implementation Document

Your detailed implementation document is available in the repository:
[specs/implementation_docs/lin-71-safe-model-types-implementation.md](../specs/implementation_docs/lin-71-safe-model-types-implementation.md)

## Project Context

This task is part of a coordinated 4-agent effort to restore TypeScript strict mode compliance. You will work in parallel with 2 other Remote Agents after the ARCHitect completes the foundation Jest infrastructure fixes (LIN-70).

Your task focuses on SAFe model type completeness including:
- Fixing enum import and usage patterns
- Adding missing required properties to test objects
- Ensuring complete type definitions for SAFe models

## Key Responsibilities

1. **Fix enum imports and usage** in test files (DependencyType, DependencyStrength, DetectionMethod)
2. **Add missing required properties** to test objects (acceptanceCriteria, etc.)
3. **Update test object factories** to use proper type-safe patterns
4. **Validate type completeness** for all SAFe model definitions
5. **Ensure clean compilation** in your scope
6. **Document any type definition improvements**
7. Write comprehensive tests for all components
8. Document the API with JSDoc comments

## Existing Codebase Context

The following files are relevant to your task:
- `src/types/dependency-types.ts`: Enum definitions (DependencyType, DependencyStrength, DetectionMethod)
- `src/planning/models.ts`: SAFe model definitions (Story, Feature, Epic, Enabler)
- `tests/integration/safe/art-planning-integration.test.ts`: Test file with enum usage issues
- `tests/types/test-types.ts`: Test object factories

## Definition of Done

Your task will be considered complete when:
- All enum imports use correct module paths
- All enum usage follows TypeScript enum patterns (e.g., DependencyType.REQUIRES)
- All test objects have required properties (acceptanceCriteria, etc.)
- Clean TypeScript compilation in your file scope
- All existing tests still pass
- Code is well-documented with JSDoc comments
- Tests are comprehensive and passing
- Pull request is submitted and approved

## Branching and PR Guidelines

- Create a branch named `fix/safe-model-type-completeness`
- Make your changes in this branch
- Submit a PR to the `dev` branch when complete
- Include a detailed description of your changes in the PR

## Timeline

- Estimated effort: 3 story points
- Expected completion: Within 2-3 hours
- **Dependency**: Wait for LIN-70 completion before starting

## Communication

- Update progress in Linear issue LIN-71
- Provide regular updates on your progress
- Flag any blockers or dependencies as soon as possible
- Coordinate with ARCHitect for any architectural questions

## Dependencies

**Upstream**: LIN-70 (Jest Mock Infrastructure) must complete first
**Parallel**: LIN-72 (Linear SDK) and LIN-73 (Property Definitions)
**Downstream**: None - isolated scope

## Coordination Notes

- **Wait for LIN-70 completion** before starting your work
- Your scope is isolated from other agents to prevent conflicts
- ARCHitect will coordinate any integration issues
- Focus only on SAFe model type issues in your assigned files

---

Thank you for your contribution to the TypeScript strict mode compliance effort. Your work on SAFe model type completeness is essential for maintaining type safety across our SAFe planning infrastructure.

The ARCHitect will be available to answer questions and provide guidance throughout the implementation process.
