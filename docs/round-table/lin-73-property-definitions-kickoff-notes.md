# Kick-off: Source Code Property Definitions Fixes (LIN-73)

**Document Type:** Remote Agent Kickoff Notes
**Author:** Auggie III, ARCHitect-in-the-IDE
**Date:** July 8, 2025
**Agent Assignment:** Remote Agent #4
**Priority:** MEDIUM - Property definitions

## Assignment Overview

You are assigned to fix missing property definitions in core source files. This is part of a coordinated 4-agent effort to restore TypeScript strict mode compliance.

## Linear Project Information

- **Linear Issue**: [LIN-73](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/issue/LIN-73/source-code-property-definitions-fixes)
- **Parent Issue**: [LIN-44](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/issue/LIN-44/complete-jest-infrastructure-agent-process-improvements)
- **Linear Team**: [Linear agents](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/team/LIN)
- **Priority**: Medium (2)
- **Story Points**: 2
- **Labels**: technical-debt, architecture

## Linear Issue Creation

As part of this task, you should:
1. ✅ Issue already created: [LIN-73](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/issue/LIN-73)
2. Update the issue status to "In Progress" when you begin
3. Add progress comments as you work
4. Set to "In Review" when PR is submitted

## Implementation Document

Your detailed implementation document is available in the repository:
[specs/implementation_docs/lin-73-property-definitions-implementation.md](../specs/implementation_docs/lin-73-property-definitions-implementation.md)

## Project Context

This task is part of a coordinated 4-agent effort to restore TypeScript strict mode compliance. You will work in parallel with 2 other Remote Agents after the ARCHitect completes the foundation Jest infrastructure fixes (LIN-70).

Your task focuses on adding missing property definitions including:
- Adding missing `intervalMinutes` property
- Fixing undefined property access issues
- Ensuring complete interface definitions

## Key Responsibilities

1. **Add missing property definitions** in core source files
2. **Fix `intervalMinutes` property** and similar missing properties
3. **Ensure complete interface definitions** for all types
4. **Add proper type annotations** where missing
5. **Validate property access patterns** are type-safe
6. **Document property definitions** with JSDoc comments
7. Write comprehensive tests for all components
8. Document the API with JSDoc comments

## Existing Codebase Context

The following files are relevant to your task:
- Core source files with missing property definitions
- Interface definitions that need completion
- Type definition files requiring property additions
- Configuration objects missing properties

## Definition of Done

Your task will be considered complete when:
- All missing properties are defined in interfaces
- `intervalMinutes` and similar properties are properly typed
- No undefined property access errors in your scope
- Complete interface definitions for all types
- Clean TypeScript compilation in your file scope
- All existing functionality still works
- Code is well-documented with JSDoc comments
- Tests are comprehensive and passing
- Pull request is submitted and approved

## Branching and PR Guidelines

- Create a branch named `fix/source-code-property-definitions`
- Make your changes in this branch
- Submit a PR to the `dev` branch when complete
- Include a detailed description of your changes in the PR

## Timeline

- Estimated effort: 2 story points
- Expected completion: Within 1-2 hours
- **Dependency**: Wait for LIN-70 completion before starting

## Communication

- Update progress in Linear issue LIN-73
- Provide regular updates on your progress
- Flag any blockers or dependencies as soon as possible
- Coordinate with ARCHitect for any architectural questions

## Dependencies

**Upstream**: LIN-70 (Jest Mock Infrastructure) must complete first
**Parallel**: LIN-71 (SAFe Models) and LIN-72 (Linear SDK)
**Downstream**: None - isolated scope

## Coordination Notes

- **Wait for LIN-70 completion** before starting your work
- Your scope is isolated from other agents to prevent conflicts
- ARCHitect will coordinate any integration issues
- Focus only on property definition issues in your assigned files

## Common Property Definition Patterns

### Missing Property Example

**Before** (causing TypeScript error):
```typescript
interface Config {
  name: string;
  // Missing: intervalMinutes property
}

const config: Config = {
  name: 'test',
  intervalMinutes: 5 // Error: Property doesn't exist
};
```

**After** (properly defined):
```typescript
interface Config {
  name: string;
  intervalMinutes: number;
}

const config: Config = {
  name: 'test',
  intervalMinutes: 5 // ✅ Valid
};
```

### Optional vs Required Properties

**Consider whether properties should be optional**:
```typescript
interface Config {
  name: string;
  intervalMinutes?: number; // Optional
  // OR
  intervalMinutes: number;  // Required
}
```

Thank you for your contribution to the TypeScript strict mode compliance effort. Your work on property definitions is essential for maintaining complete type safety across our codebase.

The ARCHitect will be available to answer questions and provide guidance throughout the implementation process.
