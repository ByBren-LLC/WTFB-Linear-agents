## üîç **LESSONS LEARNED**

### **What We Learned About AI Collaboration**
1. **Initial assessments can be incomplete** when TypeScript compilation masks implementation depth
2. **Evidence-based responses** are crucial for accurate technical evaluation
3. **Round Table philosophy works** - collaborative problem-solving yields better results
4. **Documentation structure matters** - organized communication improves efficiency

### **Technical Insights**
1. **ES6+ iteration patterns** can cause TypeScript compatibility issues in enterprise projects
2. **Comprehensive testing** requires proper Jest setup with SAFe coverage thresholds
3. **Phase-based implementation** allows for systematic validation and quality control
4. **Linear integration** requires careful attention to workflow state management

### **Process Insights**
1. **3-day implementation sprints** work well for complex enterprise features
2. **Daily progress updates** maintain transparency and enable course correction
3. **Formal communication structure** (`docs/round-table/`) improves collaboration quality
4. **Trust scores evolve** based on evidence and execution quality
