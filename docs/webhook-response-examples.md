### New Assignment - Large Story
**Context**: 13-point story

```markdown
üéØ I've been assigned to **LIN-567: Redesign reporting module**

I notice this is a large story (13 points). According to SAFe best practices, stories over 8 points should be decomposed.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Recommendations:**
‚Ä¢ Break down into 3-4 smaller stories
‚Ä¢ Each story should be 3-5 points
‚Ä¢ Maintain clear acceptance criteria
‚Ä¢ Consider vertical slicing

Would you like me to suggest a breakdown structure? I can help create sub-stories that:
‚Ä¢ Deliver incremental value
‚Ä¢ Reduce risk
‚Ä¢ Improve flow
‚Ä¢ Enable parallel work

## New Comment Responses

### Direct Question
**Event**: New comment with question and mention
**Comment**: "@saafepulse can you help estimate this work?"

```markdown
Hi @engineer,

Thanks for reaching out! I see you have a question about **LIN-234: Database optimization**.

For estimation questions, I can help analyze the scope and suggest story point values based on SAFe guidelines.

**To provide accurate estimation, I'll need:**
‚Ä¢ Clear acceptance criteria
‚Ä¢ Technical complexity assessment
‚Ä¢ Dependencies identification
‚Ä¢ Similar story reference points

**Quick Estimation Framework:**
‚Ä¢ 1-2 points: Simple, well-understood changes
‚Ä¢ 3-5 points: Moderate complexity, some unknowns
‚Ä¢ 8 points: Complex, multiple components
‚Ä¢ 13+ points: Should be decomposed

Based on the current description, this appears to be moderate complexity (3-5 points), but let's review the details together.
