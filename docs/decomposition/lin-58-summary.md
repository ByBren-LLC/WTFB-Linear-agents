# LIN-58 Decomposition Summary

## Decomposition Complete ✅

Successfully decomposed LIN-58 (8 points) into 3 manageable sub-stories following SAFe guidelines.

## Sub-Stories Created

| ID | Title | Points | Status |
|----|-------|--------|---------|
| LIN-61 | Implement base command parser with intent recognition | 3 | Created |
| LIN-62 | Build parameter extraction and context awareness | 3 | Created |
| LIN-63 | Create CLI executor bridge for command execution | 2 | Created |
| **Total** | | **8** | ✅ |

## Key Achievements

### ✅ SAFe Compliance
- All sub-stories ≤5 points
- Clear value delivery per story
- Independent testability

### ✅ Technical Clarity
- Well-defined interfaces
- Clear dependencies
- Specific acceptance criteria

### ✅ Implementation Path
1. **Foundation First**: Command parser (LIN-61)
2. **Intelligence Second**: Parameter extraction (LIN-62)  
3. **Execution Last**: CLI bridge (LIN-63)

## Dependencies Mapped

```
LIN-57 (Webhook Processors) ✅
    ↓
LIN-61 (Command Parser)
    ↓
LIN-62 (Parameter Extraction)
    ↓
LIN-63 (CLI Executor)
```

## Next Actions

1. **Review Sub-Stories**: Validate acceptance criteria with team
2. **Prioritize LIN-61**: Start with parser foundation
3. **Assign Resources**: Determine sprint allocation
4. **Update Roadmap**: Include in next PI planning

## Success Metrics

- Intent recognition: >95% accuracy
- Parameter extraction: >90% accuracy
- Command execution: >98% success rate
- Response time: <5 seconds total
