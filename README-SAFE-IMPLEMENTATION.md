# SAFe Implementation in Linear

This branch contains the research findings and implementation for the SAFe Implementation in Linear spike. The goal of this spike was to research and document the optimal approach for implementing SAFe methodology in Linear, including mapping SAFe concepts to Linear entities, establishing naming conventions, labeling strategies, and relationship management.

## Files in this Branch

- `safe_implementation_in_linear_research.md`: Comprehensive research findings and recommendations
- `safe_linear_mapping_diagram.md`: Visual representations of the SAFe hierarchy in Linear
- `src/safe/safe_linear_implementation.ts`: Implementation of the SAFe Linear utility
- `src/safe/safe_linear_implementation.test.ts`: Tests for the SAFe Linear utility
- `docs/safe_linear_implementation_guide.md`: Implementation guide with examples
- `specs/safe_implementation_in_linear_planning.md`: Planning document for the research

## Key Findings

1. **SAFe Hierarchy Representation**: Use parent-child relationships between Issues to represent the SAFe hierarchy (Epic -> Feature -> Story)
2. **Relationship Management**: Use Linear's built-in parent-child relationships
3. **Labeling and Categorization**: Use a combination of Labels for SAFe levels and categories
4. **Program Increment Implementation**: Use Cycles for Program Increments

## Implementation

The implementation provides a utility class `SAFeLinearImplementation` that:

- Creates and manages Epics, Features, Stories, and Enablers
- Creates and manages Program Increments
- Assigns Features to Program Increments
- Retrieves SAFe entities from Linear

## Next Steps

1. **Create Required Labels**: Set up the necessary labels in Linear for SAFe implementation
2. **Configure Workflow States**: Configure Linear workflow states to align with SAFe
3. **Create Templates**: Develop templates for Epics, Features, Stories, and Enablers
4. **Implement Planning Agent**: Develop the Planning Agent based on the recommendations
5. **Train Users**: Provide training on the SAFe implementation in Linear
6. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review the implementation and make adjustments as needed

## Linear Issue
