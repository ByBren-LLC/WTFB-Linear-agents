## üõ†Ô∏è Script Development Guidelines

### Adding New Scripts

When adding new scripts to this directory:

1. **Naming Convention**: Use descriptive names with hyphens
   - Planning: `start-[type]-agent.sh`
   - Assignment: `assign-[function].sh`
   - Utility: `update-[target].sh`

2. **Documentation**: Include detailed comments and usage instructions

3. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error checking and user feedback

4. **Integration**: Ensure compatibility with existing workflow

5. **Testing**: Test all functionality before committing

6. **README Updates**: Update this README with new script information

### Script Standards

- Use `#!/bin/bash` shebang
- Include script description header
- Implement `set -e` for error handling
- Use color-coded output for user feedback
- Provide help/usage information
- Include examples in documentation

### Dependencies

Scripts may require:
- Git (for file movement and version control)
- Linear CLI (for issue management)
- Augment CLI (for agent startup)
- Standard Unix utilities (find, grep, sed, etc.)

## üìö Integration

These scripts integrate with:

- **specs/** folder structure and WIP methodology
- **Linear** project management and issue tracking
- **GitHub** repository and branch management
- **SAFe** methodology and workflow compliance
- **Remote agents** across multiple platforms

For detailed workflow documentation, see:
