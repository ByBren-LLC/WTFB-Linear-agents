**Orchestration System**: 5-Agent ART Planning Implementation  
**Execution Model**: Phase-gated parallel development with dependency management  
**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks optimized delivery

## üìã Phase-Based Agent Deployment

### **Phase 1: Foundation Deployment** (Start Immediately)

#### Agent #2 Assignment Script
```bash
# Deploy Foundation Agent for Story Decomposition Engine
echo "üéØ PHASE 1 DEPLOYMENT: Foundation Agent"
echo "Deploying Agent #2 - Story Decomposition Engine (LIN-47)"
echo "Critical Path: 3-4 days"

**Agent #2 Assignment: Story Decomposition Engine**

I'm assigning you to implement the **foundational capability** for our ART Planning system. This is the Story Decomposition Engine that automatically breaks down large stories into implementable sub-stories.

**Linear Issue**: LIN-47 - Story Decomposition Engine  
**Parent Story**: LIN-46 (ART Planning and Story Decomposition)  
**Priority**: High (1) - **CRITICAL PATH**  
**Story Points**: 3  
**Timeline**: 3-4 days  

## Your Mission

Implement the foundational story decomposition engine that automatically breaks down large stories (>5 points) into implementable sub-stories (‚â§5 points each) while maintaining SAFe compliance and business value.

**CRITICAL**: This is the foundation that enables LIN-48, LIN-49, and LIN-50. Your APIs must be ready for downstream integration.

## Assignment Details

Please:

1. **Pull the latest code** from the dev branch: https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents
2. **Read your kickoff note**: https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents/blob/dev/specs/kickoff_notes/story_decomposition_engine_kickoff.md
3. **Review the Linear issue**: LIN-47 (Story Decomposition Engine)
4. **Study the implementation document**: https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents/blob/dev/specs/todo/story-decomposition-engine-story.md
5. **Review orchestration plan**: /specs/ART_PLANNING_ORCHESTRATION.md
6. **Implement in 3 phases** as outlined in the kickoff note
7. **Create branch**: `feature/story-decomposition-engine`
8. **Submit PR when complete**

**Integration Requirements**: Your implementation must provide these APIs for downstream agents:
```typescript
interface StoryDecompositionAPI {
  decomposeStory(story: LargeStory): Promise<DecomposedStory[]>;
  validateDecomposition(decomposed: DecomposedStory[]): Promise<ValidationResult>;
  getBusinessValueMapping(story: Story): Promise<BusinessValue>;
}
```

**Phase Gate 1 Exit Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Core decomposition algorithms implemented
- ‚úÖ API endpoints for downstream integration ready  
- ‚úÖ Unit tests passing (>80% coverage)
- ‚úÖ Large story breakdown validation working
- ‚úÖ SAFe compliance validation implemented
- ‚úÖ Linear issue updated to "In Review"
- ‚úÖ PR submitted with integration documentation

This is **Sub-Story 1 of 4** in the ART Planning system and **enables all other ART planning capabilities**.
