# User Story Implementation: System Health Monitoring with Slack Notifications

## Story Information
- **Story ID**: TBD (to be assigned in Linear)
- **Parent Feature**: Agent Operations Slack Integration Technical Enabler
- **Story Points**: 5
- **Priority**: Medium

## Story Description
As a development operations team member, I want system health monitoring with Slack notifications, so that I can proactively monitor OAuth token expiration, API rate limits, resource usage, and system health issues before they impact planning operations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] System health monitoring tracks OAuth token expiration for Linear and Confluence
- [ ] API rate limit monitoring alerts when approaching limits for Linear and Confluence APIs
- [ ] Resource usage monitoring tracks database connections, memory usage, and disk space
- [ ] Budget tracking monitors API call usage against configured limits
- [ ] Proactive notifications warn of issues before they become critical
- [ ] Health check endpoint provides system status for external monitoring
- [ ] Configuration allows setting thresholds and notification preferences
- [ ] Error handling ensures monitoring failures don't affect core operations
- [ ] Notifications include actionable guidance for resolving issues

## Technical Context
### System Health Components to Monitor
Based on the Linear Planning Agent architecture, key health indicators include:

**Authentication Health:**
- OAuth token expiration (Linear and Confluence)
- Token refresh success/failure rates
- Authentication error rates

**API Health:**
- Linear API rate limit usage and remaining calls
- Confluence API rate limit usage and remaining calls
- API response times and error rates
- Webhook delivery success rates

**System Resources:**
- Database connection pool status (PostgreSQL)
- SQLite database file size and performance
- Memory usage and garbage collection metrics
- Disk space usage for logs and data files

**Operational Health:**
- Sync process health and last successful sync
- Planning operation success/failure rates
- Webhook processing queue status

### Dependencies
- **Requires**: Enhanced SlackNotifier implementation
- **Integrates with**: Existing Linear and Confluence API clients
- **Monitors**: OAuth token management, database connections, API usage

### Technical Constraints
- Monitoring must have minimal performance impact
- Health checks must not interfere with core operations
- Failed monitoring must not break planning functionality
- Notifications must be actionable and not create alert fatigue

       lastRefresh: Date;
     };
     confluenceToken: {
       expiresAt: Date;
       daysUntilExpiration: number;
       isHealthy: boolean;
       lastRefresh: Date;
     };
   }
   ```

3. **API Rate Limit Monitoring**
   ```typescript
   interface APIHealthStatus {
     linear: {
       remainingCalls: number;
       totalCalls: number;
       resetTime: Date;
       usagePercentage: number;
       isHealthy: boolean;

       totalGB: number;
       usagePercentage: number;
       isHealthy: boolean;
     };
   }
   ```

### Technical Design
```typescript
export class HealthMonitor {
  private slackNotifier: EnhancedSlackNotifier;
  private config: HealthMonitorConfig;
  private monitoringInterval: NodeJS.Timeout | null = null;
  private lastAlerts: Map<string, number> = new Map();

  constructor(slackNotifier: EnhancedSlackNotifier, config: HealthMonitorConfig) {
    this.slackNotifier = slackNotifier;
    this.config = {
      checkIntervalMs: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
      tokenExpirationWarningDays: 7,
      apiUsageWarningPercentage: 80,
      memoryUsageWarningPercentage: 85,
      diskUsageWarningPercentage: 90,
      alertThrottleMs: 60 * 60 * 1000, // 1 hour
      ...config
    };
  }

  async startMonitoring(): Promise<void> {
    logger.info('Starting health monitoring');
    
    // Initial health check
    await this.performHealthCheck();
    
    // Schedule periodic health checks
    this.monitoringInterval = setInterval(async () => {
      try {
        await this.performHealthCheck();
      } catch (error) {
        logger.error('Error during health check', { error });
      }
    }, this.config.checkIntervalMs);
  }

  private async performHealthCheck(): Promise<SystemHealthStatus> {
    const tokenHealth = await this.checkOAuthTokenHealth();
    const apiHealth = await this.checkAPIRateLimits();
    const resourceHealth = await this.checkSystemResources();
    const operationalHealth = await this.checkOperationalHealth();

    const overallHealth: SystemHealthStatus = {
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      isHealthy: tokenHealth.isHealthy && apiHealth.isHealthy && 
                resourceHealth.isHealthy && operationalHealth.isHealthy,
      components: {
        tokens: tokenHealth,
        apis: apiHealth,
        resources: resourceHealth,
        operations: operationalHealth
      }
    };

    // Send alerts for unhealthy components
    await this.processHealthAlerts(overallHealth);

    return overallHealth;
  }
}
```

## SAFe Considerations
- Enables proactive system management and reliability
- Supports continuous monitoring and improvement practices
- Provides operational intelligence for planning team reliability
- Enables predictive maintenance and issue prevention
- Supports DevOps culture with comprehensive system observability

## Security Considerations
- Health monitoring should not expose sensitive system information
- OAuth token monitoring should not log actual token values
- Health check endpoint should require authentication for detailed information
- Alert notifications should not include sensitive configuration details

## Performance Considerations
- Health monitoring has configurable intervals to minimize impact
- Resource monitoring uses efficient system calls and caching
- Failed health checks are logged but don't retry excessively
- Health check endpoint responses are cached for performance

## Documentation Requirements
- Document all health monitoring components and their purposes
- Provide configuration examples for different monitoring scenarios
- Create troubleshooting guide for health monitoring setup
- Document alert thresholds and their meanings
