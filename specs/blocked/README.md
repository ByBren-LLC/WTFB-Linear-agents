# Blocked - Waiting on Dependencies

This folder contains work items that are **blocked by external dependencies** and cannot be assigned until those dependencies are resolved.

## Current Status
- **0 blocked files** (folder ready for new blocked work)
- Monitoring system in place for dependency tracking
- Ready to receive work items with unresolved dependencies

## Contents

### Currently Empty
All previously blocked OAuth authentication dependencies have been resolved and moved to archive:
- ✅ `confluence-oauth-routes-story.md` - Completed and archived
- ✅ `oauth-applications-setup-story.md` - Completed and archived
- ✅ `oauth-environment-config-story.md` - Completed and archived
- ✅ `oauth-routes-integration-enabler.md` - Completed and archived

## Blocking Dependencies

### No Current Blockers
**Status**: All dependencies resolved
**Previous Blocker**: OAuth Infrastructure (✅ Completed)
**Current State**: Ready to receive new blocked work items

#### Historical Dependencies (Now Resolved)
1. ✅ **OAuth Route Registration**: Confluence OAuth routes registered in Express server
2. ✅ **Environment Configuration**: OAuth environment variables complete
3. ✅ **Application Setup**: OAuth applications created in Linear/Atlassian consoles
4. ✅ **Integration Testing**: OAuth flow validated in local environment

## Dependency Resolution Process

### Monitoring Dependencies
1. **Regular Review**: Check dependency status weekly
2. **Stakeholder Communication**: Coordinate with OAuth implementation team
3. **Readiness Assessment**: Verify when dependencies are resolved
4. **Unblocking Process**: Move files to `todo/` when ready

### Unblocking Criteria

#### OAuth Dependencies (✅ All Resolved):
- [x] Confluence OAuth routes registered in Express server
- [x] Environment variables properly configured
- [x] OAuth applications created and configured
- [x] OAuth flow tested and validated
- [x] Authentication tokens can be obtained and refreshed

#### Template for Future Dependencies:
- [ ] Dependency 1: [Description]
- [ ] Dependency 2: [Description]
- [ ] Dependency 3: [Description]

### File Movement Commands

#### Moving to Todo (When Unblocked)
```bash
git mv specs/blocked/[filename] specs/todo/[filename]
git commit -m "unblock: resolve dependencies for [task-name]

Dependencies resolved:
- [Dependency 1] ✅
- [Dependency 2] ✅
- [Dependency 3] ✅

Ready for assignment to remote agents

[Agent-ID: LIN-ARCH-01-C01]"
```

#### Moving from Todo (If New Dependencies Discovered)
```bash
git mv specs/todo/[filename] specs/blocked/[filename]
git commit -m "block: discovered dependencies for [task-name]

Blocking dependencies identified:
- [Dependency 1] ❌
- [Dependency 2] ❌

Moving to blocked until resolved

[Agent-ID: LIN-ARCH-01-C01]"
```

## Impact Analysis

### Blocked Features
- **Confluence Integration**: Cannot sync with Confluence without OAuth
- **Planning Automation**: Limited planning capabilities without document access
- **Full Workflow**: Complete Linear-Confluence workflow blocked
- **Agent Operations**: Some agent operations depend on Confluence access

### Business Impact
- **Reduced Functionality**: Core features unavailable
- **User Experience**: Limited workflow capabilities
- **Project Timeline**: Potential delays in full feature delivery
- **Value Realization**: Delayed business value from Confluence integration

## Workaround Strategies

### Temporary Solutions
1. **Manual Processes**: Use manual Confluence document processing
2. **Limited Integration**: Focus on Linear-only features
3. **Mock Data**: Use mock Confluence data for development
4. **Phased Delivery**: Deliver non-Confluence features first

### Alternative Approaches
- **API Token Authentication**: Consider simpler token-based auth
- **Reduced Scope**: Implement subset of Confluence features
- **External Integration**: Use external OAuth service
- **Delayed Implementation**: Defer Confluence features to later phase

## Monitoring and Communication

### Status Tracking
- **Weekly Reviews**: Check OAuth implementation progress
- **Dependency Updates**: Monitor external team progress
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Regular updates on blocking status
- **Timeline Adjustments**: Update project timelines as needed

### Escalation Process
1. **Team Level**: Coordinate with OAuth implementation team
2. **Project Level**: Escalate to project management if delays
3. **Stakeholder Level**: Inform stakeholders of timeline impacts
4. **Executive Level**: Escalate if business impact significant

## Readiness Preparation

### Pre-Unblocking Activities
- **Implementation Review**: Ensure specifications are current
- **Kickoff Updates**: Update kickoff notes with latest information
- **Assignment Preparation**: Prepare assignment templates
- **Agent Identification**: Identify agents for assignment

### Quality Assurance
- **Dependency Verification**: Confirm all dependencies truly resolved
- **Integration Testing**: Verify OAuth integration works end-to-end
- **Documentation Updates**: Update any changed requirements
- **Assignment Readiness**: Ensure smooth transition to `todo/`

## Success Criteria

### Unblocking Success
- All OAuth dependencies resolved and tested
- Files successfully moved to `todo/` folder
- Agents can be immediately assigned
- No additional blockers discovered

### Process Success
- Clear communication about blocking status
- Proactive dependency monitoring
- Smooth unblocking process
- Minimal delay once dependencies resolved

## Future Prevention

### Dependency Management
- **Early Identification**: Identify dependencies during planning
- **Parallel Development**: Coordinate dependent work streams
- **Risk Mitigation**: Plan workarounds for critical dependencies
- **Communication Protocols**: Establish clear dependency communication

### Process Improvements
- **Dependency Tracking**: Better tools for dependency monitoring
- **Cross-Team Coordination**: Improved coordination processes
- **Risk Assessment**: Better risk assessment for dependencies
- **Contingency Planning**: Develop backup plans for blocked work
