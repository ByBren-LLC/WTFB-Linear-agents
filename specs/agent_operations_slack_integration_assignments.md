## Agent #5 Assignment

# Remote Agent Assignment: Agent Operations Slack Integration Technical Enabler

I'm assigning you to implement the Agent Operations Slack Integration Technical Enabler for our Linear Planning Agent project. This is a medium priority architectural component that will complete the integration of operational intelligence notifications into the planning agent workflows, providing visibility into planning operations, system health, and workflow status that complement Linear's existing Slack integration.

Please:
1. Pull the latest code from the main branch of our repository: https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents
2. Read your kickoff note: https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents/blob/main/specs/kickoff_notes/agent_operations_slack_integration_enabler_kickoff.md
3. Create a Linear issue as instructed in the kickoff note
4. Study the implementation document referenced in the kickoff note
5. Implement the task according to the specifications
6. Create a branch named `feature/agent-operations-slack-integration`
7. Submit a PR when complete

This is a medium priority task that enables operational intelligence notifications for planning operations, system health monitoring, and workflow status updates. This provides value beyond Linear's existing issue notifications. Please let me know if you have any questions or need clarification on any aspect of the implementation.

## Assignment Summary

- **Agent #5**: Agent Operations Slack Integration Technical Enabler (8 story points, 1-2 weeks)
- **Agent #6**: Enhanced SlackNotifier for Operational Intelligence (3 story points, 3-4 days)
- **Agent #7**: Planning Agent Slack Integration (3 story points, 3-4 days, depends on #6)
- **Agent #8**: System Health Monitoring with Slack Notifications (5 story points, 1 week, depends on #6)

**Total Effort**: 19 story points across 4 agents
**Priority**: Medium - Enables operational intelligence and proactive monitoring
**Project**: WTFB Linear Planning Agent
**Methodology**: SAFe Essentials

## Dependencies

- **Agent #6** (Enhanced SlackNotifier) must complete before **Agent #7** and **Agent #8** can begin
- **Agent #5** (Technical Enabler) coordinates overall implementation and integration
- All agents should coordinate through Linear issues and PR reviews

## Key Value Proposition

This implementation provides operational intelligence notifications that complement (not duplicate) Linear's existing Slack integration:

- **Planning Operations**: Bulk planning completion, statistics, failure notifications
- **System Health**: OAuth token expiration, API rate limits, resource usage
- **Workflow Intelligence**: Remote agent status, PR reviews, deployment notifications
- **Proactive Monitoring**: Early warning system for potential issues

The notifications focus on operational intelligence that Linear wouldn't naturally provide, giving teams visibility into the planning agent's health and operations.
