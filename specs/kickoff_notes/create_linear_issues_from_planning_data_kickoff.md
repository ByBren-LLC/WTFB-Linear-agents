# Kick-off: Create Linear Issues from Planning Data

## Assignment Overview

You are assigned to implement the Create Linear Issues from Planning Data user story for the Linear Planning Agent project. This component will use the Linear API to create properly structured issues with the appropriate hierarchy and relationships.

## Linear Project Information

- **Linear Project**: [SAFe Agents](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/project/safe-agents-41505bde79df/overview)
- **Linear Team**: [Linear Agents](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/team/LIN/all)

## Linear Issue Creation

As part of this task, you should:

1. Create a new issue in the Linear project
2. Set the issue type to "User Story"
3. Set the priority to "High"
4. Title the issue "Create Linear Issues from Planning Data"
5. Include a brief description referencing this implementation document
6. Add the label "linear-integration"
7. Assign the issue to yourself

## Implementation Document

Your detailed implementation document is available in the repository:
[Create Linear Issues from Planning Data Implementation](https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents/blob/dev/specs/todo/create_linear_issues_from_planning_data-implementation.md)

## Project Context

The Linear Planning Agent will serve as a SAFe Technical Delivery Manager (TDM) within Linear.app, bridging high-level planning and task execution. This agent will analyze Confluence documentation, create properly structured Linear issues, and maintain SAFe hierarchy and relationships.

Your task is to implement the functionality to create Linear issues from extracted planning information. This includes:

- Creating epics, features, stories, and enablers in Linear
- Creating parent-child relationships between issues
- Setting appropriate labels, priorities, and other attributes
- Handling API rate limits and errors

## Key Responsibilities

1. Implement a Linear issue creator class
2. Implement issue mapping functions
3. Implement issue updater for existing issues
4. Implement issue finder to find existing issues
5. Implement rate limiting and error handling
6. Implement planning session manager
7. Write comprehensive tests for all components
8. Document the API with JSDoc comments

## Existing Codebase Context

The following files are relevant to your task:

- `src/planning/models.ts`: Planning information models (to be implemented in the Extract Planning Information task)
- `src/safe/safe_linear_implementation.ts`: SAFe implementation in Linear
- `src/auth/tokens.ts`: Token management for Linear OAuth

## Definition of Done

Your task will be considered complete when:

- All acceptance criteria in the implementation document are met
- The agent can create epics, features, stories, and enablers in Linear
- The agent can create parent-child relationships between issues
- The agent can handle API rate limits and errors
- Code is well-documented with JSDoc comments
- Tests are comprehensive and passing
- Pull request is submitted and approved

## Branching and PR Guidelines

- Create a branch named `feature/create-linear-issues`
- Make your changes in this branch
- Submit a PR to the `dev` branch when complete
- Include a detailed description of your changes in the PR

## Timeline

- Estimated effort: 5 story points
- Expected completion: Within 1-2 weeks

## Communication

- If you have questions or need clarification, please comment on your assigned Linear issue
- Provide regular updates on your progress
- Flag any blockers or dependencies as soon as possible

## Dependencies

This task depends on the Extract Planning Information user story and the SAFe Implementation in Linear spike. You may need to coordinate with the agents implementing those tasks to ensure compatibility.

---

Thank you for your contribution to the Linear Planning Agent project. Your work on creating Linear issues from planning data is a critical component that will enable the agent to create properly structured issues in Linear based on planning documents in Confluence.

The ARCHitect will be available to answer questions and provide guidance throughout the implementation process.
