# Kick-off: Create Planning Session UI

## Assignment Overview
You are assigned to implement the Create Planning Session UI user story for the Linear Planning Agent project. This component will provide a web interface for users to initiate planning sessions, select Confluence documents, and monitor the progress of planning sessions.

## Linear Project Information
- **Linear Project**: [SAFe Agents](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/project/safe-agents-41505bde79df/overview)
- **Linear Team**: [Linear Agents](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/team/LIN/all)

## Linear Issue Creation
As part of this task, you should:
1. Create a new issue in the Linear project
2. Set the issue type to "User Story"
3. Set the priority to "Medium"
4. Title the issue "Create Planning Session UI"
5. Include a brief description referencing this implementation document
6. Add the label "ui"
7. Assign the issue to yourself

## Implementation Document
Your detailed implementation document is available in the repository:
[Create Planning Session UI Implementation](https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents/blob/main/specs/create_planning_session_ui-implementation.md)

## Project Context
The Linear Planning Agent will serve as a SAFe Technical Delivery Manager (TDM) within Linear.app, bridging high-level planning and task execution. This agent will analyze Confluence documentation, create properly structured Linear issues, and maintain SAFe hierarchy and relationships.

Your task is to implement the user interface for creating and managing planning sessions. This includes:
- Creating a new planning session
- Selecting a Confluence document by URL or search
- Displaying the progress of the planning session
- Showing errors and warnings during the planning session
- Viewing the results of the planning session

## Key Responsibilities
1. Set up frontend framework (React and TypeScript)
2. Implement App component and routing
3. Implement New Session page
4. Implement Session Details page
5. Implement Session List page
6. Implement API client for planning sessions
7. Implement UI components (buttons, forms, progress bars, etc.)
8. Write comprehensive tests for all components
9. Document the API with JSDoc comments

## Existing Codebase Context
The following files are relevant to your task:
- `src/planning/session-manager.ts`: Planning session manager (to be implemented in the Create Linear Issues from Planning Data task)
- `src/db/models.ts`: Database models for storing planning sessions

## Definition of Done
Your task will be considered complete when:
- All acceptance criteria in the implementation document are met
- The UI allows users to create and manage planning sessions
- The UI is responsive and works on desktop and mobile devices
- The UI is accessible and follows web accessibility guidelines
- Code is well-documented with JSDoc comments
- Tests are comprehensive and passing
- Pull request is submitted and approved

## Branching and PR Guidelines
- Create a branch named `feature/planning-session-ui`
- Make your changes in this branch
- Submit a PR to the `dev` branch when complete
- Include a detailed description of your changes in the PR

## Timeline
- Estimated effort: 5 story points
- Expected completion: Within 1-2 weeks

## Communication
- If you have questions or need clarification, please comment on your assigned Linear issue
- Provide regular updates on your progress
- Flag any blockers or dependencies as soon as possible

## Dependencies
This task depends on the Planning Session State Management user story. You may need to coordinate with the agent implementing that task to ensure compatibility.
