# Kick-off: LIN-60 Enhanced Response System

## Assignment Overview

You are enhancing the agent response system with context-aware, multi-part responses, rich formatting, and progress updates for complex operations. This polishes the user experience for the completed command intelligence pipeline and autonomous behaviors.

**This transforms agent interactions from basic text responses to professional, context-aware communications that enhance user experience and provide actionable insights.**
