### Issue Description Template
```markdown
## Technical Enabler: Agent Operations Slack Integration

Complete the Agent Operations Slack Integration by wiring the existing SlackNotifier class into the Linear Planning Agent's operational workflows.

### Scope
This enabler provides operational intelligence notifications for:
- Planning operations (completion, statistics, failures)
- System health monitoring (OAuth tokens, API limits, resources)
- Workflow status (remote agents, PR status, deployments)
- Error handling (critical system errors, integration failures)

### Value
Enables proactive monitoring and operational intelligence that complements (not duplicates) Linear's existing Slack integration.

### Implementation Document
[Agent Operations Slack Integration Enabler](https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents/blob/main/specs/agent-operations-slack-integration-enabler.md)

### Child Stories
- Enhanced SlackNotifier for Operational Intelligence
- Planning Agent Slack Integration  
- System Health Monitoring with Slack Notifications

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] SlackNotifier integrated into PlanningAgent for planning notifications
- [ ] SlackNotifier integrated into SyncManager for sync status notifications
- [ ] SlackNotifier integrated into webhook handlers for operational notifications
- [ ] System health monitoring with proactive notifications
- [ ] All notifications distinct from Linear's issue notifications
- [ ] Comprehensive testing validates all notification scenarios
```

### Linking Instructions
After creating the issue:
1. Link to any existing Slack integration issues in the LIN team
2. Link to any system monitoring or observability issues
3. Link to any planning agent operational issues

## Project Context
The Linear Planning Agent serves as a SAFe Technical Delivery Manager (TDM) within Linear.app, bridging high-level planning and task execution. This agent analyzes Confluence documentation, creates properly structured Linear issues, and maintains SAFe hierarchy and relationships.

Your task is to complete the Agent Operations Slack Integration by implementing operational intelligence notifications that provide visibility into planning operations, system health, and workflow status. This includes:

- Integrating existing SlackNotifier into planning workflows
- Implementing system health monitoring with proactive notifications
- Creating operational intelligence that complements Linear's Slack integration
- Ensuring notifications are actionable and provide clear value

## Implementation Document
Read the detailed implementation document: [Agent Operations Slack Integration Enabler](https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents/blob/main/specs/agent-operations-slack-integration-enabler.md)

This document contains:
- Complete technical analysis and justification
- Detailed implementation plan and architecture
- Integration points and notification categories
- Testing approach and acceptance criteria
- Security and performance considerations

## Key Files and Components
You'll be working with these key files:

### Existing Files to Understand
- `src/integrations/slack.ts`: Existing SlackNotifier implementation (foundation)
- `src/agent/planning.ts`: PlanningAgent implementation (integration point)
- `src/sync/sync-manager.ts`: SyncManager implementation (integration point)
- `src/webhooks/handler.ts`: Webhook handlers (integration point)
- `.env.template`: Environment configuration (Slack webhook URL)

### Files to Create/Modify
- `src/integrations/enhanced-slack-notifier.ts`: Enhanced operational intelligence notifier
- `src/monitoring/health-monitor.ts`: System health monitoring with notifications
- `src/types/notification-types.ts`: Notification data structures
- `src/utils/notification-manager.ts`: Centralized notification management

## Definition of Done
Your task will be considered complete when:
- All acceptance criteria in the implementation document are met
- Enhanced SlackNotifier provides operational intelligence methods
- PlanningAgent integrates SlackNotifier for planning notifications
- SyncManager integrates SlackNotifier for sync status notifications
- Webhook handlers integrate SlackNotifier for operational notifications
- System health monitoring provides proactive notifications
- All notifications are distinct from Linear's issue notifications
- Comprehensive testing validates all notification scenarios
- Documentation is updated with setup and configuration guidance
- Code follows project coding standards
- No performance impact on core planning agent operations
- Security requirements are met for notification content

## Technical Approach
### Phase 1: Enhanced SlackNotifier (Story 1)
1. Create enhanced SlackNotifier with operational intelligence methods
2. Implement notification categories and formatting
3. Add configuration management for notification types

### Phase 2: Planning Agent Integration (Story 2)
1. Integrate SlackNotifier into PlanningAgent workflows
2. Add planning statistics tracking and notifications
3. Implement planning failure notifications with actionable guidance

### Phase 3: System Health Monitoring (Story 3)
1. Implement OAuth token expiration monitoring
2. Add API rate limit monitoring and alerting
3. Create resource usage monitoring and notifications

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing
1. Integrate all components into cohesive system
2. Comprehensive testing of all notification scenarios
3. Documentation and configuration guidance

## Communication Protocol
- **Questions**: Comment on your assigned Linear issue
- **Progress Updates**: Update Linear issue status and provide regular progress comments
- **Blockers**: Flag any blockers or dependencies immediately in Linear issue
- **Architectural Decisions**: Tag @scott for any architectural clarifications needed

## Dependencies
This technical enabler has the following dependencies:
- **OAuth Routes Integration**: Should be completed (currently in progress with remote agents)
- **Existing SlackNotifier**: Already implemented and ready for enhancement
- **Planning Agent**: Fully implemented and ready for integration
- **SyncManager**: Fully implemented and ready for integration

## Timeline and Effort
- **Story Points**: 8 (across 3 user stories)
- **Estimated Timeline**: 1-2 weeks
- **Complexity**: Medium (integration and enhancement of existing components)

## Success Criteria
The enabler will be successful when:
1. **Operational Intelligence**: Teams receive actionable notifications about planning operations
2. **Proactive Monitoring**: System health issues are detected and alerted before they become critical
3. **No Duplication**: Notifications complement rather than duplicate Linear's Slack integration
4. **Performance**: No impact on core planning agent functionality
5. **Adoption**: Teams find the notifications valuable and actionable

## Security and Compliance
- Notification content must not include sensitive data (tokens, credentials)
- Slack webhook URL must be kept secure and not logged
- Error notifications must not expose internal system details
- Configuration must allow disabling notifications for security-sensitive environments

## Quality Standards
- All code must follow project TypeScript and coding standards
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests required
- Documentation must be clear and include configuration examples
- Error handling must be robust and not affect core functionality
- Performance impact must be minimal and measured
