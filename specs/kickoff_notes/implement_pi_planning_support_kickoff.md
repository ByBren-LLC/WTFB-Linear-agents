# Kick-off: Implement PI Planning Support

## Assignment Overview
You are assigned to conduct the Implement PI Planning Support spike for the Linear Planning Agent project. This research task will inform how we implement Program Increment (PI) Planning in the Linear Planning Agent.

## Linear Project Information
- **Linear Project**: [SAFe Agents](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/project/safe-agents-41505bde79df/overview)
- **Linear Team**: [Linear Agents](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/team/LIN/all)

## Linear Issue Creation
As part of this task, you should:
1. Create a new issue in the Linear project
2. Set the issue type to "Spike"
3. Set the priority to "Medium"
4. Title the issue "Implement PI Planning Support"
5. Include a brief description referencing this implementation document
6. Add the labels "research" and "pi-planning"
7. Assign the issue to yourself

## Implementation Document
Your detailed implementation document is available in the repository:
[Implement PI Planning Support Implementation](https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents/blob/main/specs/implement_pi_planning_support-implementation.md)

## Project Context
The Linear Planning Agent will serve as a SAFe Technical Delivery Manager (TDM) within Linear.app, bridging high-level planning and task execution. This agent will analyze Confluence documentation, create properly structured Linear issues, and maintain SAFe hierarchy and relationships.

Your task is to research and implement support for Program Increment (PI) Planning in the Linear Planning Agent. This includes:
- Researching PI Planning in SAFe methodology
- Implementing PI models and managers
- Extracting PI information from Confluence documents
- Creating a UI for PI Planning

## Key Responsibilities
1. Research PI Planning in SAFe methodology
2. Implement PI models
3. Implement PI manager class
4. Implement PI extractor for Confluence documents
5. Implement PI Planning UI
6. Implement PI API
7. Write comprehensive tests for all components
8. Document the API with JSDoc comments

## Existing Codebase Context
The following files are relevant to your task:
- `src/safe/safe_linear_implementation.ts`: SAFe implementation in Linear
- `src/planning/models.ts`: Planning information models

## Definition of Done
Your task will be considered complete when:
- All acceptance criteria in the implementation document are met
- The agent can create Program Increments in Linear
- The agent can assign features to Program Increments
- The agent can track Program Increment progress
- The agent can identify and extract PI information from Confluence documents
- Code is well-documented with JSDoc comments
- Tests are comprehensive and passing
- Pull request is submitted and approved

## Branching and PR Guidelines
- Create a branch named `spike/implement-pi-planning-support`
- Make your changes in this branch
- Submit a PR to the `dev` branch when complete
- Include a detailed description of your findings and implementation in the PR

## Timeline
- Time-Box: 5 days
- Expected completion: Within 1-2 weeks

## Communication
- If you have questions or need clarification, please comment on your assigned Linear issue
- Provide regular updates on your progress
- Flag any blockers or dependencies as soon as possible

## Dependencies
This task depends on the SAFe Implementation in Linear spike, Create Linear Issues from Planning Data user story, and Maintain SAFe Hierarchy user story. You may need to coordinate with the agents implementing those tasks to ensure compatibility.

---

Thank you for your contribution to the Linear Planning Agent project. Your work on implementing PI Planning support is critical for enabling the agent to organize work into time-boxed planning intervals according to SAFe methodology, which is an essential component of SAFe.

The ARCHitect will be available to answer questions and provide guidance throughout the research and implementation process.
