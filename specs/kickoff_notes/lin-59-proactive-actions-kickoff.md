# Kick-off: LIN-59 Proactive Agent Actions

## Assignment Overview

You are implementing autonomous agent behaviors that provide continuous value through proactive monitoring, suggestions, and workflow automation. This builds on the completed command intelligence pipeline (LIN-57/58) to create an intelligent agent that acts without explicit user commands.

**This transforms the Linear agent from reactive (responds to commands) to proactive (provides ongoing value through autonomous monitoring and suggestions).**

## Linear Project Information

- **Linear Project**: [WTFB Linear Agents](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/team/LIN/active)
- **Linear Team**: [LIN Team](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/team/LIN)
- **Epic**: [LIN-56 Linear Agent Interactive Capabilities](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/issue/LIN-56/linear-agent-interactive-capabilities)

## Linear Issue Creation

As part of this task, you should:
1. Create a new issue in the Linear project
2. Set the issue type to "Feature"
3. Set the priority to "Medium (2)"
4. Title the issue "Implement Proactive Agent Actions"
5. Include a brief description referencing the implementation document
6. Add the label "agent-capabilities"
7. Assign the issue to yourself
8. Set the story points to 5
9. Link it as a child of Epic LIN-56

## Implementation Document

**Primary Reference**: [`specs/todo/lin-59-proactive-actions-implementation.md`](../todo/lin-59-proactive-actions-implementation.md)

This document contains:
- Complete technical specifications
- Autonomous behavior definitions
- Integration requirements with existing systems
- Testing strategy and success metrics
- Implementation phases and timeline

## Technical Context

### Foundation Available (Completed)
- âœ… **Command Intelligence Pipeline** (LIN-57/58) - Complete and operational
- âœ… **Webhook Infrastructure** - Ready for autonomous behavior integration
- âœ… **Linear API Integration** - Comprehensive client wrapper available
- âœ… **Slack Integration** - Operational notification system ready
- âœ… **ART Planning Modules** - 6,649+ lines of planning capabilities

### Your Mission
Implement 6 core autonomous behaviors:
1. **Story Monitoring** - Auto-suggest decomposition for stories >5 points
2. **ART Health Monitoring** - Alert when readiness drops below 85%
3. **Dependency Detection** - Suggest mapping when new epics created
4. **Workflow Automation** - Auto-move assigned issues to "In Progress"
5. **Periodic Reporting** - Weekly ART health reports to stakeholders
6. **Planning Anomaly Detection** - Alert teams to planning inconsistencies

## Architecture Integration

### Build On Existing Systems
- **Extend webhook handler** (`src/webhooks/handler.ts`) for autonomous triggers
- **Use Linear client** (`src/linear/client.ts`) for issue interactions
- **Leverage Slack notifications** (`OperationalNotificationCoordinator`)
- **Integrate ART planning modules** (`src/safe/`) for health monitoring
- **Enhance response templates** (`src/agent/responses.ts`)

### New Components to Create
```
src/agent/
â”œâ”€â”€ autonomous-engine.ts                    # Main autonomous behavior engine
â”œâ”€â”€ behaviors/                              # Individual behavior implementations
â”œâ”€â”€ monitoring/                             # Health monitoring and scheduling
â””â”€â”€ types/                                  # Type definitions for autonomous systems
```

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core Engine (Day 1)

- Integration testing and validation

### Phase 3: Advanced Behaviors (Day 3)
- Dependency detection behavior (mapping suggestions)
- Periodic reporting behavior (weekly reports)
- Anomaly detection behavior (planning alerts)
- Performance optimization

### Phase 4: Integration & Polish (Day 4)
- Complete integration testing
- Performance monitoring and metrics
- Documentation completion
- Production readiness validation
