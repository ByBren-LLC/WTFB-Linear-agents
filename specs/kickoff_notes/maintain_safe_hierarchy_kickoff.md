# Kick-off: Maintain SAFe Hierarchy

## Assignment Overview
You are assigned to implement the Maintain SAFe Hierarchy user story for the Linear Planning Agent project. This component will ensure that the relationships between epics, features, stories, and enablers are properly maintained in Linear, even as planning documents are updated.

## Linear Project Information
- **Linear Project**: [SAFe Agents](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/project/safe-agents-41505bde79df/overview)
- **Linear Team**: [Linear Agents](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/team/LIN/all)

## Linear Issue Creation
As part of this task, you should:
1. Create a new issue in the Linear project
2. Set the issue type to "User Story"
3. Set the priority to "High"
4. Title the issue "Maintain SAFe Hierarchy"
5. Include a brief description referencing this implementation document
6. Add the label "safe"
7. Assign the issue to yourself

## Implementation Document
Your detailed implementation document is available in the repository:
[Maintain SAFe Hierarchy Implementation](https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents/blob/main/specs/maintain_safe_hierarchy-implementation.md)

## Project Context
The Linear Planning Agent will serve as a SAFe Technical Delivery Manager (TDM) within Linear.app, bridging high-level planning and task execution. This agent will analyze Confluence documentation, create properly structured Linear issues, and maintain SAFe hierarchy and relationships.

Your task is to implement the functionality to maintain the SAFe hierarchy in Linear. This includes:
- Updating existing issues to maintain parent-child relationships
- Detecting and resolving conflicts when relationships change
- Handling reorganization of the SAFe hierarchy
- Maintaining relationships when new items are added or existing items are removed

## Key Responsibilities
1. Implement a SAFe hierarchy manager class
2. Implement relationship updater
3. Implement conflict resolution
4. Implement hierarchy validator
5. Implement hierarchy synchronizer
6. Write comprehensive tests for all components
7. Document the API with JSDoc comments

## Existing Codebase Context
The following files are relevant to your task:
- `src/planning/models.ts`: Planning information models (to be implemented in the Extract Planning Information task)
- `src/safe/safe_linear_implementation.ts`: SAFe implementation in Linear
- `src/linear/issue-creator.ts`: Linear issue creator (to be implemented in the Create Linear Issues from Planning Data task)
- `src/linear/issue-updater.ts`: Linear issue updater (to be implemented in the Create Linear Issues from Planning Data task)
- `src/linear/issue-finder.ts`: Linear issue finder (to be implemented in the Create Linear Issues from Planning Data task)

## Definition of Done
Your task will be considered complete when:
- All acceptance criteria in the implementation document are met
- The agent can update existing issues to maintain parent-child relationships
- The agent can detect and resolve conflicts when relationships change
- The agent can handle reorganization of the SAFe hierarchy
- Code is well-documented with JSDoc comments
- Tests are comprehensive and passing
- Pull request is submitted and approved

## Branching and PR Guidelines
- Create a branch named `feature/maintain-safe-hierarchy`
- Make your changes in this branch
- Submit a PR to the `dev` branch when complete
- Include a detailed description of your changes in the PR

## Timeline
- Estimated effort: 5 story points
- Expected completion: Within 1-2 weeks

## Communication
- If you have questions or need clarification, please comment on your assigned Linear issue
- Provide regular updates on your progress
- Flag any blockers or dependencies as soon as possible

## Dependencies
This task depends on the Create Linear Issues from Planning Data user story and the SAFe Implementation in Linear spike. You may need to coordinate with the agents implementing those tasks to ensure compatibility.

---

Thank you for your contribution to the Linear Planning Agent project. Your work on maintaining the SAFe hierarchy is critical for ensuring that the relationships between work items are properly represented and maintained over time, which is essential for the agent to function correctly.

The ARCHitect will be available to answer questions and provide guidance throughout the implementation process.
