# Kick-off: Synchronize Linear with Confluence

## Assignment Overview
You are assigned to implement the Synchronize Linear with Confluence user story for the Linear Planning Agent project. This component will ensure that changes to planning documents in Confluence are reflected in Linear issues, and vice versa.

## Linear Project Information
- **Linear Project**: [SAFe Agents](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/project/safe-agents-41505bde79df/overview)
- **Linear Team**: [Linear Agents](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/team/LIN/all)

## Linear Issue Creation
As part of this task, you should:
1. Create a new issue in the Linear project
2. Set the issue type to "User Story"
3. Set the priority to "Medium"
4. Title the issue "Synchronize Linear with Confluence"
5. Include a brief description referencing this implementation document
6. Add the label "synchronization"
7. Assign the issue to yourself

## Implementation Document
Your detailed implementation document is available in the repository:
[Synchronize Linear with Confluence Implementation](https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents/blob/main/specs/synchronize_linear_with_confluence-implementation.md)

## Project Context
The Linear Planning Agent will serve as a SAFe Technical Delivery Manager (TDM) within Linear.app, bridging high-level planning and task execution. This agent will analyze Confluence documentation, create properly structured Linear issues, and maintain SAFe hierarchy and relationships.

Your task is to implement the functionality to synchronize Linear issues with Confluence documents. This includes:
- Detecting changes to Confluence documents
- Updating Linear issues based on changes to Confluence documents
- Detecting changes to Linear issues
- Updating Confluence documents based on changes to Linear issues
- Handling conflicts between Confluence and Linear

## Key Responsibilities
1. Implement synchronization manager class
2. Implement synchronization models
3. Implement change detector
4. Implement conflict resolver
5. Implement synchronization API
6. Implement scheduled synchronization
7. Write comprehensive tests for all components
8. Document the API with JSDoc comments

## Existing Codebase Context
The following files are relevant to your task:
- `src/confluence/client.ts`: Confluence API client (to be implemented in the Confluence API Integration task)
- `src/confluence/parser.ts`: Confluence document parser (to be implemented in the Parse Confluence Documents task)
- `src/planning/extractor.ts`: Planning information extractor (to be implemented in the Extract Planning Information task)
- `src/linear/issue-creator.ts`: Linear issue creator (to be implemented in the Create Linear Issues from Planning Data task)
- `src/linear/issue-updater.ts`: Linear issue updater (to be implemented in the Create Linear Issues from Planning Data task)
- `src/safe/hierarchy-manager.ts`: SAFe hierarchy manager (to be implemented in the Maintain SAFe Hierarchy task)

## Definition of Done
Your task will be considered complete when:
- All acceptance criteria in the implementation document are met
- The agent can detect changes to Confluence documents and Linear issues
- The agent can update Linear issues based on changes to Confluence documents
- The agent can update Confluence documents based on changes to Linear issues
- The agent can handle conflicts between Confluence and Linear
- Code is well-documented with JSDoc comments
- Tests are comprehensive and passing
- Pull request is submitted and approved

## Branching and PR Guidelines
- Create a branch named `feature/synchronize-linear-with-confluence`
- Make your changes in this branch
- Submit a PR to the `dev` branch when complete
- Include a detailed description of your changes in the PR

## Timeline
- Estimated effort: 8 story points
- Expected completion: Within 2-3 weeks

## Communication
- If you have questions or need clarification, please comment on your assigned Linear issue
- Provide regular updates on your progress
- Flag any blockers or dependencies as soon as possible

## Dependencies
This task depends on the Confluence API Integration technical enabler, Parse Confluence Documents user story, Extract Planning Information user story, Create Linear Issues from Planning Data user story, Maintain SAFe Hierarchy user story, and Linear API Error Handling technical enabler. You may need to coordinate with the agents implementing those tasks to ensure compatibility.

Thank you for your contribution to the Linear Planning Agent project. Your work on synchronizing Linear with Confluence is critical for ensuring that changes to planning documents are reflected in Linear issues, and vice versa, which is essential for maintaining consistency between the two systems.

The ARCHitect will be available to answer questions and provide guidance throughout the implementation process.
