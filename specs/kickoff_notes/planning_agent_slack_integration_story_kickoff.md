2. Link to the Enhanced SlackNotifier story as a dependency
3. Link to any existing PlanningAgent or planning-related issues

## Project Context
The Linear Planning Agent (`src/agent/planning.ts`) is responsible for analyzing Confluence documentation and creating properly structured Linear issues following SAFe methodology. Your task is to integrate the Enhanced SlackNotifier to provide operational intelligence about planning operations.

## Implementation Document
Read the detailed implementation document: [Planning Agent Slack Integration Story](https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents/blob/main/specs/planning-agent-slack-integration-story.md)

This document contains:
- Complete analysis of PlanningAgent integration points
- Detailed notification requirements and content examples
- Statistics tracking and collection approach
- Testing approach and acceptance criteria

## Key Files and Components
You'll be working with these key files:

### Existing Files to Understand
- `src/agent/planning.ts`: PlanningAgent implementation (main integration point)
- `src/safe/safe_linear_implementation.ts`: SAFe implementation used by PlanningAgent
- `src/safe/pi-planning.ts`: PI planning functionality
- `src/integrations/confluence.ts`: Confluence API integration

### Files to Create/Modify
- `src/agent/planning.ts`: Add Enhanced SlackNotifier integration
- `src/types/planning-types.ts`: Planning statistics and notification data structures

### Dependencies
- **Enhanced SlackNotifier**: Must be completed before this story
- **Existing PlanningAgent**: Fully implemented and ready for integration

## Technical Requirements
### Integration Points
Your implementation should integrate notifications at these key points:

1. **Planning Start** - When planning operations begin
2. **Planning Completion** - When planning operations complete successfully
3. **Planning Failure** - When planning operations fail with errors
4. **PI Creation** - When Program Increment planning completes
5. **Statistics Collection** - Track and report planning metrics

### Planning Statistics to Track
```typescript
interface PlanningStatistics {
  planningTitle: string;
  confluencePageUrl: string;
  duration: number;
  epicCount: number;
  featureCount: number;
  storyCount: number;
  enablerCount: number;
  piCount?: number;
  objectiveCount?: number;
  riskCount?: number;
}
```

### Notification Content Examples
Your notifications should be formatted like:

**Planning Completion:**
```
‚úÖ Planning Completed: "Q1 2025 Planning"
üìä Created: 1 Epic, 5 Features, 23 Stories, 3 Enablers
‚è±Ô∏è Duration: 2.3 minutes
üìÑ Source: Confluence Page "Q1 Planning Document"
üîó View in Linear: [Epic Link]
```

**Planning Failure:**
```
‚ùå Planning Failed: "Q1 2025 Planning"
üö® Error: Could not parse Confluence document structure
üìÑ Source: Confluence Page "Q1 Planning Document"
üí° Action: Check document format and SAFe structure
üìã Details: Missing Epic section in document
```

## Definition of Done
Your task will be considered complete when:
- All acceptance criteria in the implementation document are met
- PlanningAgent integrates EnhancedSlackNotifier successfully
- Planning statistics are accurately collected and reported
- All planning notification types are implemented and tested
- Error handling ensures notification failures don't affect planning
- Configuration allows fine-grained control of planning notifications
- Comprehensive tests validate all planning notification scenarios
- Documentation covers setup, configuration, and troubleshooting
- Code follows project coding standards
- No performance impact on planning operations

## Implementation Steps
1. **Add EnhancedSlackNotifier to PlanningAgent constructor** with optional configuration
2. **Implement planning statistics tracking** throughout planning workflows
3. **Add planning start notifications** at beginning of planning operations
4. **Integrate completion notifications** with comprehensive statistics
5. **Add failure notifications** with actionable error information
6. **Implement PI creation notifications** with PI-specific statistics
7. **Add configuration management** for planning notification preferences
8. **Create comprehensive tests** for all notification scenarios
9. **Update error handling** to include notification context
10. **Document configuration options** and notification content

## Testing Requirements
### Unit Tests Required
- Test PlanningAgent integration with EnhancedSlackNotifier
- Test planning statistics collection and calculation
- Test notification content formatting and accuracy
- Test error handling when notifications fail
- Test configuration management for planning notifications

### Integration Tests Required
- Test end-to-end planning workflow with notifications
- Test PI creation workflow with notifications
- Test planning failure scenarios with error notifications

### Manual Testing
- Execute planning operations and verify Slack notifications
- Test different planning scenarios (success, failure, PI creation)
- Verify notification content is accurate and actionable

## Communication Protocol
- **Questions**: Comment on your assigned Linear issue
- **Progress Updates**: Update Linear issue status and provide regular progress comments
- **Blockers**: Flag any blockers or dependencies immediately in Linear issue
- **Code Reviews**: Request review from team members when ready

## Dependencies
This story has the following dependencies:
- **Enhanced SlackNotifier**: Must be completed first (blocking dependency)
- **Existing PlanningAgent**: Fully implemented and ready for integration
- **SAFe Implementation**: Already implemented and used by PlanningAgent

## Timeline and Effort
- **Story Points**: 3
- **Estimated Timeline**: 3-4 days
- **Complexity**: Medium (integration with existing complex component)

## Success Criteria
The story will be successful when:
1. **Operational Intelligence**: Planning teams receive valuable insights about planning operations
2. **Actionable Notifications**: Failure notifications provide clear guidance for resolution
3. **Performance**: No impact on planning operation execution time
4. **Quality**: Code meets project standards with comprehensive testing
5. **Adoption**: Planning teams find the notifications valuable and informative

## Security Considerations
- Planning notifications should not include sensitive Confluence content
- Error notifications should not expose internal system details
- Configuration should allow disabling notifications for sensitive environments

## Quality Standards
- All code must follow project TypeScript and coding standards
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests required
- Documentation must include configuration examples and troubleshooting guidance
- Error handling must be robust and not affect planning functionality
- Performance impact must be minimal and measured
