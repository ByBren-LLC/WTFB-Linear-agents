# Kick-off: OAuth Routes Integration Technical Enabler

## Assignment Overview
You are assigned to implement the OAuth Routes Integration Technical Enabler for the Linear Planning Agent project. This is a critical architectural enabler that completes the OAuth authentication system by integrating missing Confluence OAuth routes into the Express server and ensuring proper environment configuration for both Linear and Confluence OAuth flows.

## Linear Project Information
- **Linear Project**: [SAFe Agents](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/project/safe-agents-41505bde79df/overview)
- **Linear Team**: [Linear Agents](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/team/LIN/all)

## Linear Issue Creation
As part of this task, you should:
1. Create a new issue in the Linear project
2. Set the issue type to "Technical Enabler"
3. Set the priority to "High"
4. Title the issue "OAuth Routes Integration Technical Enabler"
5. Include a brief description: "Complete OAuth authentication system by integrating missing Confluence OAuth routes and environment configuration"
6. Add the labels "architecture", "oauth", "enabler"
7. Assign the issue to yourself
8. Set story points to 5
9. Link to any existing OAuth-related issues in the LIN team

## Implementation Document
Your detailed implementation document is available in the repository:
[OAuth Routes Integration Enabler Implementation](https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents/blob/main/specs/oauth-routes-integration-enabler.md)

## Project Context
The Linear Planning Agent serves as a SAFe Technical Delivery Manager (TDM) within Linear.app, bridging high-level planning and task execution. This agent analyzes Confluence documentation, creates properly structured Linear issues, and maintains SAFe hierarchy and relationships.

Your task is to complete the OAuth authentication system that enables the agent to authenticate with both Linear and Confluence. Currently, the system has:
- ✅ Complete Linear OAuth implementation
- ✅ Complete Confluence OAuth implementation  
- ❌ Missing Confluence OAuth route registration in Express server
- ❌ Incomplete environment configuration

This enabler addresses the critical gap where Confluence OAuth handlers exist but are not registered in the main server, preventing full OAuth functionality.

## Key Deliverables
Your implementation should include:
- Confluence OAuth routes properly registered in `src/index.ts`
- Session middleware configured for OAuth state management
- Complete environment variable templates for OAuth
- Docker configuration supporting OAuth environment variables
- Comprehensive testing of OAuth flows
- Updated documentation for OAuth setup process

## Technical Architecture Impact
This enabler completes the authentication layer:

```

After completion:

│   Linear API    │    │  Express Server  │    │ Confluence API  │
│                 │    │                  │    │                 │

└─────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

## Dependencies and Blockers
- This enabler has no dependencies - all OAuth implementations are complete
- This enabler BLOCKS all Confluence-dependent features
- This enabler is REQUIRED for bidirectional synchronization functionality
- This enabler is PREREQUISITE for end-to-end testing

## Definition of Done
Your task will be considered complete when:
- All acceptance criteria in the implementation document are met
- Confluence OAuth routes are properly registered in Express server
- Session middleware is configured for OAuth state management
- Environment templates include all required OAuth variables
- Docker configuration supports OAuth environment variables
- Local Docker testing validates complete OAuth flow
- Both Linear and Confluence authentication work end-to-end
- Error handling is comprehensive for all OAuth scenarios
- Documentation is updated to reflect OAuth setup process
- Code follows project coding standards
- Tests are comprehensive and passing
- Pull request is submitted and approved

## Branching and PR Guidelines
- Create a branch named `feature/oauth-routes-integration-enabler`
- Make your changes in this branch
- Submit a PR to the `dev` branch when complete
- Include a detailed description of your changes in the PR following our template:
  - Overview of changes
  - Technical details
  - Testing performed
  - Impact assessment
  - Related issues

## Timeline
- Estimated effort: 5 story points
- Expected completion: Within 1 week
- This is HIGH PRIORITY as it unblocks multiple dependent features

## Communication
- If you have questions or need clarification, please comment on your assigned Linear issue
- Provide regular updates on your progress in the Linear issue
- Flag any blockers or dependencies as soon as possible
- Tag @scott for any architectural decisions or clarifications needed

## Security Considerations
- OAuth tokens must be stored securely in database with encryption
- Session secrets must be properly configured
- Redirect URIs must be validated
- HTTPS required for production OAuth flows
- Follow OAuth security best practices

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for route registration and middleware configuration
- Integration tests for complete OAuth flows
- End-to-end tests in Docker environment
- Error scenario testing
- Performance validation

## Files You'll Be Working With
Primary files to modify:
- `src/index.ts` - Add Confluence OAuth routes and session middleware
- `.env.template` - Add missing OAuth environment variables
- `docker-compose.yml` - Add OAuth environment variables
- `docs/setup-guide.md` - Update OAuth setup instructions

Reference files (already implemented):
- `src/auth/confluence-oauth.ts` - Complete Confluence OAuth implementation
- `src/auth/oauth.ts` - Complete Linear OAuth implementation
- `src/auth/tokens.ts` - Token management and refresh
- `src/db/models.ts` - Database schema for token storage

## Success Metrics
- OAuth routes respond correctly to requests
- Session state is maintained during OAuth flows
- Tokens are stored and retrieved successfully
- Error scenarios are handled gracefully
- Documentation is clear and complete
- No regressions in existing functionality

---

Thank you for your contribution to the Linear Planning Agent project. Your work on completing the OAuth authentication system is a critical architectural enabler that will unlock the full functionality of the planning agent and enable seamless integration between Linear and Confluence.

This enabler is essential for the success of the entire project - without it, users cannot authenticate with Confluence, and the core planning functionality cannot work. Your implementation will directly enable all downstream features that depend on Confluence access.
