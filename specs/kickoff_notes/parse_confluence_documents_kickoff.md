# Kick-off: Parse Confluence Documents

## Assignment Overview
You are assigned to implement the Parse Confluence Documents user story for the Linear Planning Agent project. This component will enable the agent to understand the structure and content of planning documents stored in Confluence.

## Linear Project Information
- **Linear Project**: [SAFe Agents](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/project/safe-agents-41505bde79df/overview)
- **Linear Team**: [Linear Agents](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/team/LIN/all)

## Linear Issue Creation
As part of this task, you should:
1. Create a new issue in the Linear project
2. Set the issue type to "User Story"
3. Set the priority to "High"
4. Title the issue "Parse Confluence Documents"
5. Include a brief description referencing this implementation document
6. Add the label "parsing"
7. Assign the issue to yourself

## Implementation Document
Your detailed implementation document is available in the repository:
[Parse Confluence Documents Implementation](https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents/blob/main/specs/parse_confluence_documents-implementation.md)

## Project Context
The Linear Planning Agent will serve as a SAFe Technical Delivery Manager (TDM) within Linear.app, bridging high-level planning and task execution. This agent will analyze Confluence documentation, create properly structured Linear issues, and maintain SAFe hierarchy and relationships.

Your task is to implement the functionality to parse Confluence documents and extract their structure and content. This includes:
- Parsing Confluence HTML content into a structured format
- Identifying headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and other common elements
- Extracting text content from these elements
- Handling Confluence macros and custom content

## Key Responsibilities
1. Implement a Confluence document parser class
2. Implement parsers for different Confluence elements
3. Implement handlers for common Confluence macros
4. Implement document structure analysis
5. Implement content extraction utilities
6. Write comprehensive tests for all components
7. Document the API with JSDoc comments

## Existing Codebase Context
The following files are relevant to your task:
- `src/confluence/client.ts`: Confluence API client (to be implemented in the Confluence API Integration task)

## Definition of Done
Your task will be considered complete when:
- All acceptance criteria in the implementation document are met
- The agent can parse Confluence HTML content into a structured format
- The agent can identify and extract content from different elements
- The agent can handle Confluence macros and custom content
- Code is well-documented with JSDoc comments
- Tests are comprehensive and passing
- Pull request is submitted and approved

## Branching and PR Guidelines
- Create a branch named `feature/parse-confluence-documents`
- Make your changes in this branch
- Submit a PR to the `dev` branch when complete
- Include a detailed description of your changes in the PR

## Timeline
- Estimated effort: 3 story points
- Expected completion: Within 1 week

## Communication
- If you have questions or need clarification, please comment on your assigned Linear issue
- Provide regular updates on your progress
- Flag any blockers or dependencies as soon as possible

## Dependencies
This task depends on the Confluence API Integration technical enabler. You may need to coordinate with the agent implementing that task to ensure compatibility.

Thank you for your contribution to the Linear Planning Agent project. Your work on parsing Confluence documents is essential for the agent to understand planning documents, which is a critical step in creating properly structured Linear issues.

The ARCHitect will be available to answer questions and provide guidance throughout the implementation process.
