# Kick-off: Linear API Error Handling

## Assignment Overview
You are assigned to implement the Linear API Error Handling technical enabler for the Linear Planning Agent project. This is a critical component that will ensure the agent can gracefully handle API errors, rate limits, and other issues when interacting with the Linear API.

## Linear Project Information
- **Linear Project**: [SAFe Agents](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/project/safe-agents-41505bde79df/overview)
- **Linear Team**: [Linear Agents](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/team/LIN/all)

## Linear Issue Creation
As part of this task, you should:
1. Create a new issue in the Linear project
2. Set the issue type to "Technical Enabler"
3. Set the priority to "High"
4. Title the issue "Linear API Error Handling"
5. Include a brief description referencing this implementation document
6. Add the label "error-handling"
7. Assign the issue to yourself

## Implementation Document
Your detailed implementation document is available in the repository:
[Linear API Error Handling Implementation](https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents/blob/main/specs/linear_api_error_handling-implementation.md)

## Project Context
The Linear Planning Agent will serve as a SAFe Technical Delivery Manager (TDM) within Linear.app, bridging high-level planning and task execution. This agent will analyze Confluence documentation, create properly structured Linear issues, and maintain SAFe hierarchy and relationships.

Your task is to implement robust error handling for the Linear API integration. This includes:
- Detecting and handling common Linear API errors
- Handling rate limiting and implementing appropriate backoff strategies
- Retrying failed requests with appropriate backoff
- Providing meaningful error messages to users

## Key Responsibilities
1. Implement error types for different Linear API errors
2. Implement error handler for detecting and handling errors
3. Implement rate limiter for respecting API limits
4. Implement retry logic for failed requests
5. Implement Linear client wrapper with error handling
6. Write comprehensive tests for all components
7. Document the API with JSDoc comments

## Existing Codebase Context
The following files are relevant to your task:
- `src/auth/tokens.ts`: Token management for Linear OAuth
- `src/safe/safe_linear_implementation.ts`: SAFe implementation in Linear

## Definition of Done
Your task will be considered complete when:
- All acceptance criteria in the implementation document are met
- The agent can detect and handle common Linear API errors
- The agent can handle rate limiting and implement appropriate backoff strategies
- The agent can retry failed requests with appropriate backoff
- Code is well-documented with JSDoc comments
- Tests are comprehensive and passing
- Pull request is submitted and approved

## Branching and PR Guidelines
- Create a branch named `feature/linear-api-error-handling`
- Make your changes in this branch
- Submit a PR to the `dev` branch when complete
- Include a detailed description of your changes in the PR

## Timeline
- Estimated effort: 3 story points
- Expected completion: Within 1 week

## Communication
- If you have questions or need clarification, please comment on your assigned Linear issue
- Provide regular updates on your progress
- Flag any blockers or dependencies as soon as possible

Thank you for your contribution to the Linear Planning Agent project. Your work on Linear API error handling is critical for ensuring the agent can gracefully handle API errors, rate limits, and other issues when interacting with the Linear API, which is essential for the agent to function reliably.

The ARCHitect will be available to answer questions and provide guidance throughout the implementation process.
