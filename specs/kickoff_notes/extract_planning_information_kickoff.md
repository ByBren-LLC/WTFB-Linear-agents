# Kick-off: Extract Planning Information

## Assignment Overview
You are assigned to implement the Extract Planning Information user story for the Linear Planning Agent project. This component will analyze parsed Confluence documents to identify epics, features, stories, enablers, and their relationships.

## Linear Project Information
- **Linear Project**: [SAFe Agents](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/project/safe-agents-41505bde79df/overview)
- **Linear Team**: [Linear Agents](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/team/LIN/all)

## Linear Issue Creation
As part of this task, you should:
1. Create a new issue in the Linear project
2. Set the issue type to "User Story"
3. Set the priority to "High"
4. Title the issue "Extract Planning Information"
5. Include a brief description referencing this implementation document
6. Add the label "planning"
7. Assign the issue to yourself

## Implementation Document
Your detailed implementation document is available in the repository:
[Extract Planning Information Implementation](https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents/blob/main/specs/extract_planning_information-implementation.md)

## Project Context
The Linear Planning Agent will serve as a SAFe Technical Delivery Manager (TDM) within Linear.app, bridging high-level planning and task execution. This agent will analyze Confluence documentation, create properly structured Linear issues, and maintain SAFe hierarchy and relationships.

Your task is to implement the functionality to extract planning information from parsed Confluence documents. This includes:
- Identifying epics, features, stories, and enablers in a Confluence document
- Extracting titles, descriptions, and other metadata for each work item
- Identifying relationships between work items (parent-child)
- Extracting acceptance criteria, story points, and other attributes

## Key Responsibilities
1. Define planning information models
2. Implement a planning information extractor class
3. Implement pattern recognition for work items
4. Implement relationship analyzer
5. Implement document structure analysis
6. Write comprehensive tests for all components
7. Document the API with JSDoc comments

## Existing Codebase Context
The following files are relevant to your task:
- `src/confluence/parser.ts`: Confluence document parser (to be implemented in the Parse Confluence Documents task)
- `src/confluence/structure-analyzer.ts`: Document structure analyzer (to be implemented in the Parse Confluence Documents task)

## Definition of Done
Your task will be considered complete when:
- All acceptance criteria in the implementation document are met
- The agent can identify epics, features, stories, and enablers in a Confluence document
- The agent can extract metadata and attributes for each work item
- The agent can identify relationships between work items
- Code is well-documented with JSDoc comments
- Tests are comprehensive and passing
- Pull request is submitted and approved

## Branching and PR Guidelines
- Create a branch named `feature/extract-planning-information`
- Make your changes in this branch
- Submit a PR to the `dev` branch when complete
- Include a detailed description of your changes in the PR

## Timeline
- Estimated effort: 5 story points
- Expected completion: Within 1-2 weeks

## Communication
- If you have questions or need clarification, please comment on your assigned Linear issue
- Provide regular updates on your progress
- Flag any blockers or dependencies as soon as possible

## Dependencies
This task depends on the Parse Confluence Documents user story. You may need to coordinate with the agent implementing that task to ensure compatibility.

Thank you for your contribution to the Linear Planning Agent project. Your work on extracting planning information is critical for the agent to understand the structure and content of planning documents, which is essential for creating properly structured Linear issues.

The ARCHitect will be available to answer questions and provide guidance throughout the implementation process.
