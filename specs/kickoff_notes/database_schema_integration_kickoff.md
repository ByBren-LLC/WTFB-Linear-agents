# Kick-off: Database Schema Integration

## Assignment Overview
You are assigned to resolve database schema conflicts and integration issues between the existing OAuth token management schema and the newly integrated planning session and synchronization schemas. This infrastructure work is essential for unified data storage.

## Linear Project Information
- **Linear Project**: [WTFB Linear Planning Agent](https://linear.app/wtfb/project/linear-planning-agent)
- **Linear Team**: [Linear Agents Team](https://linear.app/wtfb/team/linear-agents)

## Linear Issue Creation
As part of this task, you should:
1. Create a new issue in the Linear project
2. Set the issue type to "Technical Enabler"
3. Set the priority to "Medium"
4. Title the issue "Database Schema Integration"
5. Include a brief description referencing this implementation document
6. Add the label "infrastructure"
7. Assign the issue to yourself

## Implementation Document
Your detailed implementation document is available in the repository:
[Database Schema Integration Implementation](https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents/blob/main/specs/database_schema_integration-implementation.md)

## Project Context
The integration of core functionality brought in database schemas for planning sessions, synchronization state, and additional token management that may conflict with our existing OAuth token schema. These need to be harmonized to ensure all functionality works together.

Your task is to resolve these database schema conflicts and create a unified data storage strategy. This includes:
- Merging planning session schema with existing schema
- Adding synchronization state tables
- Ensuring no naming conflicts
- Establishing proper foreign key relationships

## Key Responsibilities
1. Analyze existing database schema and identify conflicts
2. Design unified schema that supports all functionality
3. Create migration files for new tables and schema changes
4. Update database model functions for new schemas
5. Test migrations on both PostgreSQL and SQLite
6. Verify all existing functionality still works
7. Document schema changes and migration strategy

## Existing Codebase Context
The following files are relevant to your task:
- `src/db/schema.sql`: Existing OAuth token schema
- `src/db/models.ts`: Database model functions
- `src/db/migrations/`: Database migration files
- `src/sync/sync-store.ts`: Synchronization state storage
- `src/planning/session-manager.ts`: Planning session storage
- `src/auth/tokens.ts`: Token management

## Definition of Done
Your task will be considered complete when:
- All acceptance criteria in the implementation document are met
- Database schemas are compatible and non-conflicting
- Migrations run successfully on both PostgreSQL and SQLite
- All database operations work correctly
- Foreign key relationships are properly established
- Existing OAuth functionality continues to work
- Tests pass for all database operations
- Pull request is submitted and approved

## Branching and PR Guidelines
- Create a branch named `feature/database-schema-integration`
- Make your changes in this branch
- Submit a PR to the `dev` branch when complete
- Include a detailed description of your changes in the PR

## Timeline
- Estimated effort: 5 story points
- Expected completion: Within 2 days

## Communication
- If you have questions or need clarification, please comment on your assigned Linear issue
- Provide regular updates on your progress
- Flag any blockers or dependencies as soon as possible

## Dependencies
- Should be started after Module Export Resolution (Agent 2) is in progress
- Can work in parallel with Type Definition Fixes (Agent 3)
- Requires Linear SDK Compatibility Layer (Agent 1) to be complete

Thank you for your contribution to the Linear Planning Agent project. Your work on Database Schema Integration is essential for creating a unified data storage strategy that supports all our functionality.

The ARCHitect will be available to answer questions and provide guidance throughout the implementation process.
