# Kick-off: Agile Release Train (ART) Planning and Story Decomposition

## Assignment Overview
You are assigned to implement the Agile Release Train (ART) Planning and Story Decomposition user story for the Linear Planning Agent project. This is a **critical missing capability** that will complete the SAFe implementation by adding sophisticated ART planning, story decomposition, dependency mapping, and iteration planning.

## Linear Project Information
- **Linear Project**: [SAFe Agents](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/project/safe-agents-41505bde79df/overview)
- **Linear Team**: [Linear Agents](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/team/LIN/all)

## Linear Issue Creation Instructions
Create a Linear issue with the following details:

### Issue Details
- **Title**: "Agile Release Train (ART) Planning and Story Decomposition"
- **Description**: 
```
As a SAFe Technical Delivery Manager (TDM), I want comprehensive Agile Release Train (ART) planning capabilities with automatic story decomposition and dependency mapping, so that I can ensure each sprint/iteration delivers working software with proper dependency management and value delivery validation.

This story addresses a critical gap in the Linear Planning Agent's SAFe implementation by adding:
- Automatic story decomposition (>5 points → ≤5 point sub-stories)
- Dependency mapping and critical path analysis
- Sprint/cycle planning with deliverable value validation
- ART readiness validation
- Story scoring and WSJF prioritization

Implementation document: https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents/blob/dev/specs/todo/agile-release-train-planning-story.md

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Story decomposition engine for >5 point stories
- Dependency mapping with Linear relationship creation
- Sprint/cycle planning ensuring deliverable value per iteration
- ART readiness validation before PI execution
- WSJF-based story scoring and prioritization
```

### Issue Configuration
- **Team**: Linear agents
- **Labels**: Add these labels (use the label names, Linear will resolve to IDs):
  - "User Story" 
  - "architecture"
  - "planning"
  - "safe"
  - "Feature"
- **Priority**: High (2)
- **Estimate**: 16 story points
- **Status**: Todo

### Linking Instructions
After creating the issue:
1. Link to existing PI planning issues (LIN-15, LIN-16, LIN-17)
2. Link to SAFe implementation issues as dependencies
3. Link to any existing planning-related issues

## Project Context
The Linear Planning Agent currently has excellent PI planning capabilities (`src/safe/pi-planning.ts`) and story extraction (`src/planning/`), but lacks the sophisticated ART planning features needed for complete SAFe implementation. This story fills that critical gap.

### Current Capabilities (Available)
- ✅ **PI Planning**: Full Program Increment planning with iterations
- ✅ **Story Extraction**: Parse stories from Confluence documents
- ✅ **SAFe Hierarchy**: Epic → Feature → Story relationships
- ✅ **Linear Integration**: Create issues with proper relationships

### Missing Capabilities (Your Mission)
- ❌ **Story Decomposition**: Break >5 point stories into sub-stories
- ❌ **Dependency Mapping**: Identify and map technical/business dependencies
- ❌ **ART Planning**: Plan iterations ensuring deliverable value
- ❌ **Story Scoring**: WSJF prioritization and business value scoring

## Technical Implementation Guide

### Existing Files to Understand
- `src/safe/pi-planning.ts`: PI planning implementation (extend this)
- `src/planning/structure-analyzer.ts`: Story extraction logic
- `src/planning/pattern-recognition.ts`: Story points extraction
- `src/agent/planning.ts`: Main planning agent (integration point)
- `src/safe/safe_linear_implementation.ts`: SAFe compliance implementation

### New Files to Create
- `src/safe/story-decomposition-engine.ts`: Story decomposition logic
- `src/safe/dependency-mapper.ts`: Dependency analysis and mapping
- `src/safe/art-planner.ts`: Agile Release Train planning
- `src/safe/story-scorer.ts`: WSJF scoring and prioritization
- `src/types/art-planning-types.ts`: Type definitions for ART planning

### Key Integration Points
1. **Extend PIManager** with ART planning capabilities
2. **Enhance PlanningAgent** to use story decomposition
3. **Add Linear API calls** for dependency relationships
4. **Integrate scoring** into planning workflow

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Story Decomposition (3 points)
**Goal**: Automatically break down large stories into implementable sub-stories

**Key Tasks**:
- Implement `StoryDecompositionEngine` class
- Add logic to detect stories >5 points
- Create sub-stories with proper parent/child relationships in Linear
- Distribute acceptance criteria across sub-stories
- Maintain traceability and SAFe compliance

**Success Criteria**:
- All >5 point stories are decomposed into ≤5 point sub-stories
- Parent/child relationships created in Linear
- Acceptance criteria properly distributed

### Phase 2: Dependency Mapping (5 points)
**Goal**: Identify and map all dependencies between work items

**Key Tasks**:
- Implement `DependencyMapper` class
- Analyze technical and business dependencies
- Create Linear dependency relationships (blocks/blocked-by)
- Validate for circular dependencies
- Calculate critical path for feature delivery

**Success Criteria**:
- Dependencies automatically identified and mapped
- Linear relationships created for all dependencies
- Critical path calculated for planning optimization

### Phase 3: ART Planning (5 points)
**Goal**: Plan iterations ensuring deliverable value and proper flow

**Key Tasks**:
- Implement `ARTPlanner` class
- Allocate stories to iterations respecting dependencies
- Ensure each iteration delivers working software
- Balance team capacity across iterations
- Validate ART readiness before PI execution

**Success Criteria**:
- Stories properly allocated to iterations
- Dependencies respected in allocation
- Each iteration contains deliverable value

### Phase 4: Scoring and Prioritization (3 points)
**Goal**: Implement WSJF prioritization and business value scoring

**Key Tasks**:
- Implement `StoryScorer` class
- Calculate business value scores
- Apply WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First) prioritization
- Update Linear issue priorities
- Consider technical dependencies in prioritization

**Success Criteria**:
- Stories scored using WSJF methodology
- Linear issue priorities updated automatically
- Prioritization considers dependencies

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test story decomposition with various story types
- Test dependency detection and mapping
- Test iteration planning algorithms
- Test scoring and prioritization logic

### Integration Tests
- Test with real PI planning scenarios
- Test Linear API integration for relationships
- Test end-to-end ART planning workflow
- Test with complex dependency chains

### SAFe Compliance Tests
