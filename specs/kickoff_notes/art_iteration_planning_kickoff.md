# Kick-off: ART Iteration Planning

## Assignment Overview
You are assigned to implement the ART Iteration Planning user story for the Linear Planning Agent project. This is the **core planning capability** of the ART Planning system (LIN-46) that ensures each sprint delivers working software with proper dependency sequencing.

## Linear Project Information
- **Linear Project**: [SAFe Agents](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/project/safe-agents-41505bde79df/overview)
- **Linear Team**: [Linear Agents](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/team/LIN/all)
- **Parent Story**: LIN-46 (Agile Release Train Planning and Story Decomposition)
- **This Story**: LIN-49 (ART Iteration Planning)

## Story Context
This is **Sub-Story 3 of 4** in the ART Planning decomposition:
- ‚úÖ **LIN-47**: Story Decomposition Engine (3 points) - **PREREQUISITE**
- ‚úÖ **LIN-48**: Dependency Mapping System (5 points) - **PREREQUISITE**
- ‚úÖ **LIN-49**: ART Iteration Planning (5 points) - **YOUR ASSIGNMENT**
- ‚è≥ **LIN-50**: Story Scoring and Prioritization (3 points) - Can run parallel

## Linear Issue Details
- **Issue**: LIN-49 - ART Iteration Planning
- **Priority**: High (1)
- **Story Points**: 5
- **Status**: Backlog ‚Üí Todo (when you start)

## Project Context
The Linear Planning Agent can now decompose stories (LIN-47) and map dependencies (LIN-48), but lacks the ability to plan iterations that ensure deliverable value each sprint. This story implements the core ART planning capability that allocates work to iterations while respecting dependencies and ensuring working software delivery.

### Your Mission
Implement ART iteration planning that:
1. **Plans** iterations ensuring deliverable value each sprint
2. **Respects** dependency ordering in story allocation
3. **Balances** team capacity across iterations
4. **Validates** ART readiness before PI execution
5. **Ensures** working software delivery each iteration

## Technical Implementation Guide

### Existing Files to Understand
- `src/safe/pi-planning.ts`: Existing PI planning infrastructure (extend this)
- `src/safe/dependency-mapper.ts`: Dependency mapping results (LIN-48 prerequisite)
- `src/safe/story-decomposition-engine.ts`: Decomposed stories (LIN-47 prerequisite)
- `src/agent/planning.ts`: Main planning agent (integration point)

### New Files to Create
- `src/safe/art-planner.ts`: Main ART iteration planning engine
- `src/safe/iteration-allocator.ts`: Story allocation algorithms

### Key Implementation Components

#### 1. ARTPlanner Class
```typescript
export class ARTPlanner {
  async planIterations(pi: ProgramIncrement, stories: Story[]): Promise<IterationPlan[]>
  async validateARTReadiness(plan: IterationPlan[]): Promise<ARTValidationResult>
  private allocateStoriesToIterations(stories: Story[], dependencies: DependencyGraph): IterationPlan[]
  private ensureDeliverableValue(iteration: IterationPlan): boolean
}
```

#### 2. Iteration Allocation
```typescript
export class IterationAllocator {
  allocateStories(stories: Story[], iterations: Iteration[], dependencies: DependencyGraph): IterationPlan[]
  private respectDependencyOrdering(stories: Story[], dependencies: DependencyGraph): Story[]
  private balanceCapacity(stories: Story[], iterations: Iteration[]): IterationPlan[]
}
```

#### 3. Capacity Management
```typescript
export class CapacityManager {
  calculateIterationCapacity(team: Team, iteration: Iteration): number
  validateCapacityAllocation(plan: IterationPlan): CapacityValidationResult
  optimizeCapacityDistribution(plans: IterationPlan[]): IterationPlan[]
}
```
