# Kick-off: Implement Token Management

## Assignment Overview
You are assigned to implement the Token Management user story for the Linear Planning Agent project. This is a critical component that will enable secure authentication with the Linear API.

## Linear Project Information
- **Linear Project**: [SAFe Agents](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/project/safe-agents-41505bde79df/overview)
- **Linear Team**: [Linear Agents](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/team/LIN/all)

## Linear Issue Creation
As part of this task, you should:
1. Create a new issue in the Linear project
2. Set the issue type to "User Story"
3. Set the priority to "High"
4. Title the issue "Implement Token Management"
5. Include a brief description referencing this implementation document
6. Add the labels "authentication" and "security"
7. Assign the issue to yourself

## Implementation Document
Your detailed implementation document is available in the repository:
[Implement Token Management Implementation](https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents/blob/main/specs/implement_token_management-implementation.md)

## Project Context
The Linear Planning Agent will serve as a SAFe Technical Delivery Manager (TDM) within Linear.app, bridging high-level planning and task execution. This agent will analyze Confluence documentation, create properly structured Linear issues, and maintain SAFe hierarchy and relationships.

Your task is to implement secure token management for Linear OAuth authentication, including:
- Storing tokens securely in the database with encryption
- Implementing token refresh when access tokens expire
- Handling error cases gracefully
- Implementing token revocation

## Key Responsibilities
1. Update the token storage to use the database instead of in-memory storage
2. Implement token encryption and decryption
3. Implement token refresh functionality
4. Update the OAuth callback to store tokens in the database
5. Implement token revocation functionality
6. Write comprehensive tests for all token management functions

## Existing Codebase Context
The following files are relevant to your task:
- `src/auth/tokens.ts`: Currently uses in-memory storage for tokens
- `src/auth/oauth.ts`: Implements OAuth flow but doesn't store tokens in the database
- `src/db/connection.ts`: Database connection setup
- `src/db/models.ts`: Database models (may need to be updated)

## Definition of Done
Your task will be considered complete when:
- All acceptance criteria in the implementation document are met
- Tokens are securely stored in the database with encryption
- Token refresh works correctly when tokens expire
- Error handling is robust and user-friendly
- Code is well-documented
- Tests are comprehensive and passing
- Pull request is submitted and approved

## Branching and PR Guidelines
- Create a branch named `feature/implement-token-management`
- Make your changes in this branch
- Submit a PR to the `dev` branch when complete
- Include a detailed description of your changes in the PR

## Timeline
- Estimated effort: 3 story points
- Expected completion: Within 1 week

## Communication
- If you have questions or need clarification, please comment on your assigned Linear issue
- Provide regular updates on your progress
- Flag any blockers or dependencies as soon as possible

## Dependencies
This task depends on the Database Schema Design technical enabler. You may need to coordinate with the agent implementing that task to ensure compatibility.

Thank you for your contribution to the Linear Planning Agent project. Your work on token management is essential for secure authentication with the Linear API, which is a foundational requirement for the agent's functionality.

The ARCHitect will be available to answer questions and provide guidance throughout the implementation process.
