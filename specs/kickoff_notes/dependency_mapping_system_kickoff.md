# Kick-off: Dependency Mapping System

## Assignment Overview
You are assigned to implement the Dependency Mapping System user story for the Linear Planning Agent project. This is a **critical sub-story** of the ART Planning capability (LIN-46) that enables automatic identification and management of dependencies between work items.

## Linear Project Information
- **Linear Project**: [SAFe Agents](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/project/safe-agents-41505bde79df/overview)
- **Linear Team**: [Linear Agents](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/team/LIN/all)
- **Parent Story**: LIN-46 (Agile Release Train Planning and Story Decomposition)
- **This Story**: LIN-48 (Dependency Mapping System)

## Story Context
This is **Sub-Story 2 of 4** in the ART Planning decomposition:
- ‚úÖ **LIN-47**: Story Decomposition Engine (3 points) - **PREREQUISITE**
- ‚úÖ **LIN-48**: Dependency Mapping System (5 points) - **YOUR ASSIGNMENT**
- ‚è≥ **LIN-49**: ART Iteration Planning (5 points) - Depends on LIN-47, LIN-48
- ‚è≥ **LIN-50**: Story Scoring and Prioritization (3 points) - Can run parallel

## Linear Issue Details
- **Issue**: LIN-48 - Dependency Mapping System
- **Priority**: High (1)
- **Story Points**: 5
- **Status**: Backlog ‚Üí Todo (when you start)

## Project Context
The Linear Planning Agent currently can decompose stories but lacks the ability to identify and manage dependencies between work items. This story implements the critical capability to automatically map technical and business dependencies, create Linear relationships, and validate dependency chains.

### Your Mission
Implement an automated dependency mapping system that:
1. **Detects** technical and business dependencies between work items
2. **Creates** Linear "blocks/blocked-by" relationships
3. **Validates** dependency graphs for circular dependencies
4. **Calculates** critical path for feature delivery
5. **Provides** dependency impact analysis

## Technical Implementation Guide

### Existing Files to Understand
- `src/planning/structure-analyzer.ts`: Story and feature extraction (integration point)
- `src/planning/pattern-recognition.ts`: Text analysis patterns (extend for dependencies)
- `src/safe/relationship-updater.ts`: Existing Linear relationship management
- `src/agent/planning.ts`: Main planning agent (integration point)

### New Files to Create
- `src/safe/dependency-mapper.ts`: Main dependency mapping engine
- `src/safe/dependency-analyzer.ts`: Dependency detection algorithms
- `src/safe/linear-dependency-manager.ts`: Linear API integration for dependencies
- `src/types/dependency-types.ts`: Type definitions for dependency mapping
- `tests/safe/dependency-mapper.test.ts`: Comprehensive unit tests

### Key Implementation Components

#### 1. DependencyMapper Class
```typescript
export class DependencyMapper {
  async mapDependencies(workItems: WorkItem[]): Promise<DependencyGraph>
  private detectTechnicalDependencies(workItems: WorkItem[]): DependencyRelationship[]
  private detectBusinessDependencies(workItems: WorkItem[]): DependencyRelationship[]
  private validateDependencyGraph(graph: DependencyGraph): string[][]
  private calculateCriticalPath(graph: DependencyGraph): string[]
}
```

#### 2. Linear Integration
```typescript
export class LinearDependencyManager {
  async createDependencyRelationships(dependencies: DependencyRelationship[]): Promise<void>
  async updateDependencyRelationships(existing: DependencyRelationship[], new: DependencyRelationship[]): Promise<void>
}
```

#### 3. Dependency Analysis
```typescript
export class DependencyAnalyzer {
  analyzeDependencyPatterns(content: string): string[]
  async performSemanticAnalysis(workItems: WorkItem[]): Promise<DependencyRelationship[]>
}
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Dependency Detection (2 points)
**Goal**: Implement algorithms to automatically identify dependencies

**Tasks**:
- Create `DependencyMapper` class with core detection logic
- Implement technical dependency detection (APIs, components, data)
- Implement business dependency detection (user flows, prerequisites)
- Add dependency strength scoring (hard/soft dependencies)
- Add comprehensive unit tests for detection algorithms

**Success Criteria**:
- Technical dependencies automatically identified from content
- Business dependencies detected from user story flows
- Dependency strength properly classified
- 90%+ accuracy in dependency detection

### Phase 2: Graph Validation and Analysis (2 points)
**Goal**: Validate dependency graphs and calculate critical paths

**Tasks**:
- Implement circular dependency detection using topological sort
- Add critical path calculation using longest path algorithm
- Implement dependency impact analysis
- Add graph validation and conflict resolution
- Test with complex dependency scenarios

**Success Criteria**:
- All circular dependencies detected and reported
- Critical path accurately calculated
- Impact analysis provides actionable insights
- Graph validation prevents invalid structures

### Phase 3: Linear Integration (1 point)
**Goal**: Create and manage dependency relationships in Linear

**Tasks**:
- Implement `LinearDependencyManager` class
- Add Linear relationship creation (blocks/blocked-by)
- Implement relationship updates and maintenance
- Add error handling and rollback capabilities
- Test with real Linear API integration

**Success Criteria**:
- Dependencies created as Linear relationships
- Relationship updates work correctly
- Error handling prevents partial updates
- Integration with existing Linear workflow

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Required)
- Test dependency detection with various content types
- Test circular dependency detection algorithms
- Test critical path calculation accuracy
- Test Linear API integration scenarios
- Test error conditions and edge cases

### Integration Tests (Required)
- Test with real planning documents and work items
- Test Linear API integration with actual relationships
- Test performance with large dependency graphs
- Test integration with existing planning workflow

### Manual Testing
- Validate dependency accuracy with manual review
- Test with complex real-world scenarios
- Verify Linear relationships are created correctly
