# Kick-off: Story Scoring and Prioritization

## Assignment Overview
You are assigned to implement the Story Scoring and Prioritization user story for the Linear Planning Agent project. This is the **optimization capability** of the ART Planning system (LIN-46) that implements WSJF prioritization and business value scoring.

## Linear Project Information
- **Linear Project**: [SAFe Agents](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/project/safe-agents-41505bde79df/overview)
- **Linear Team**: [Linear Agents](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/team/LIN/all)
- **Parent Story**: LIN-46 (Agile Release Train Planning and Story Decomposition)
- **This Story**: LIN-50 (Story Scoring and Prioritization)

## Story Context
This is **Sub-Story 4 of 4** in the ART Planning decomposition:
- ‚úÖ **LIN-47**: Story Decomposition Engine (3 points) - **PREREQUISITE**
- ‚è≥ **LIN-48**: Dependency Mapping System (5 points) - Can run parallel
- ‚è≥ **LIN-49**: ART Iteration Planning (5 points) - Can run parallel
- ‚úÖ **LIN-50**: Story Scoring and Prioritization (3 points) - **YOUR ASSIGNMENT**

## Linear Issue Details
- **Issue**: LIN-50 - Story Scoring and Prioritization
- **Priority**: High (1)
- **Story Points**: 3
- **Status**: Backlog ‚Üí Todo (when you start)

## Project Context
The Linear Planning Agent can decompose stories but lacks the ability to prioritize work based on business value and technical considerations. This story implements WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First) prioritization and business value scoring to optimize value delivery.

### Your Mission
Implement automated story scoring and prioritization that:
1. **Implements** WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First) prioritization
2. **Calculates** business value scores for stories
3. **Updates** Linear issue priorities automatically
4. **Considers** technical dependencies in prioritization
5. **Provides** value delivery optimization recommendations

## Technical Implementation Guide

### Existing Files to Understand
- `src/planning/structure-analyzer.ts`: Story extraction (integration point)
- `src/planning/pattern-recognition.ts`: Story points extraction (extend for scoring)
- `src/agent/planning.ts`: Main planning agent (integration point)
- `src/safe/dependency-mapper.ts`: Dependency information (if available)

### New Files to Create
- `src/safe/story-scorer.ts`: Main story scoring engine
- `src/safe/wsjf-calculator.ts`: WSJF prioritization algorithms
- `src/safe/value-analyzer.ts`: Business value analysis
- `src/safe/priority-updater.ts`: Linear priority updates
- `src/types/scoring-types.ts`: Type definitions for scoring
- `tests/safe/story-scorer.test.ts`: Comprehensive unit tests

### Key Implementation Components

#### 1. StoryScorer Class
```typescript
export class StoryScorer {
  async scoreStories(stories: Story[]): Promise<ScoredStory[]>
  private calculateBusinessValue(story: Story): number
  private calculateJobSize(story: Story): number
  private calculateTimeCriticality(story: Story): number
  private calculateRiskReduction(story: Story): number
}
```

#### 2. WSJF Calculator
```typescript
export class WSJFCalculator {
  calculateWSJF(businessValue: number, timeCriticality: number, riskReduction: number, jobSize: number): number
  prioritizeStories(scoredStories: ScoredStory[]): ScoredStory[]
  optimizeValueDelivery(stories: ScoredStory[], dependencies?: DependencyGraph): ScoredStory[]
}
```

#### 3. Priority Updater
```typescript
export class PriorityUpdater {
  async updateLinearPriorities(scoredStories: ScoredStory[]): Promise<void>
  private mapScoreToLinearPriority(score: number): number
  async batchUpdatePriorities(updates: PriorityUpdate[]): Promise<void>
}
```
