# Kick-off: Module Export Resolution

## Assignment Overview
You are assigned to resolve missing module exports and import/export conflicts that are preventing TypeScript compilation after our core functionality integration. This technical debt must be resolved to enable proper compilation and testing of the integrated codebase.

## Linear Project Information
- **Linear Project**: [WTFB Linear Planning Agent](https://linear.app/wtfb/project/linear-planning-agent)
- **Linear Team**: [Linear Agents Team](https://linear.app/wtfb/team/linear-agents)

## Linear Issue Creation
As part of this task, you should:
1. Create a new issue in the Linear project
2. Set the issue type to "Technical Enabler"
3. Set the priority to "High"
4. Title the issue "Module Export Resolution"
5. Include a brief description referencing this implementation document
6. Add the label "technical-debt"
7. Assign the issue to yourself

## Implementation Document
Your detailed implementation document is available in the repository:
[Module Export Resolution Implementation](https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents/blob/main/specs/module_export_resolution-implementation.md)

## Project Context
During the integration of 22,183 lines of core functionality, several module export issues were introduced that prevent TypeScript compilation. These include:
- Missing exports for planning state management
- Database functions not properly exported
- Import statements referencing non-existent exports
- Some circular dependency issues

Your task is to resolve these export/import conflicts to enable proper compilation. This includes:
- Creating missing state management exports
- Adding database function exports
- Fixing import statements
- Resolving circular dependencies

## Key Responsibilities
1. Audit all TypeScript compilation errors related to missing exports
2. Create missing exports in planning state modules
3. Add missing database function exports
4. Fix import statements that reference non-existent exports
5. Resolve any circular dependency issues
6. Test compilation and verify functionality
7. Document any export changes made

## Existing Codebase Context
The following files are relevant to your task:
- `src/planning/state.ts`: Missing PlanningSessionStatus export
- `src/db/models.ts`: Missing database function exports
- `src/planning/extractor.ts`: Import issues with planning models
- `src/sync/sync-store.ts`: Missing getDatabase export
- `src/api/planning.ts`: Cannot find planning state module

## Definition of Done
Your task will be considered complete when:
- All acceptance criteria in the implementation document are met
- TypeScript compilation succeeds for all affected files
- All missing exports are resolved
- No circular dependency issues remain
- Existing functionality is preserved
- Tests pass for all affected modules
- Pull request is submitted and approved

## Branching and PR Guidelines
- Create a branch named `feature/module-export-resolution`
- Make your changes in this branch
- Submit a PR to the `dev` branch when complete
- Include a detailed description of your changes in the PR

## Timeline
- Estimated effort: 5 story points
- Expected completion: Within 1-2 days

## Communication
- If you have questions or need clarification, please comment on your assigned Linear issue
- Provide regular updates on your progress
- Flag any blockers or dependencies as soon as possible

## Dependencies
- Should be started after Linear SDK Compatibility Layer (Agent 1) is in progress
- Blocks Type Definition Fixes (Agent 3) and Database Schema Integration (Agent 4)
