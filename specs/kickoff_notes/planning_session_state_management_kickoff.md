# Kick-off: Planning Session State Management

## Assignment Overview
You are assigned to implement the Planning Session State Management user story for the Linear Planning Agent project. This component will track the state of planning sessions, including progress, errors, and results, and provide a clean API for updating and querying the state.

## Linear Project Information
- **Linear Project**: [SAFe Agents](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/project/safe-agents-41505bde79df/overview)
- **Linear Team**: [Linear Agents](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/team/LIN/all)

## Linear Issue Creation
As part of this task, you should:
1. Create a new issue in the Linear project
2. Set the issue type to "User Story"
3. Set the priority to "Medium"
4. Title the issue "Planning Session State Management"
5. Include a brief description referencing this implementation document
6. Add the label "state-management"
7. Assign the issue to yourself

## Implementation Document
Your detailed implementation document is available in the repository:
[Planning Session State Management Implementation](https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents/blob/main/specs/planning_session_state_management-implementation.md)

## Project Context
The Linear Planning Agent will serve as a SAFe Technical Delivery Manager (TDM) within Linear.app, bridging high-level planning and task execution. This agent will analyze Confluence documentation, create properly structured Linear issues, and maintain SAFe hierarchy and relationships.

Your task is to implement the state management for planning sessions. This includes:
- Creating and initializing planning session state
- Updating planning session progress
- Recording errors and warnings during planning
- Recording the results of planning (created issues)
- Querying the current state of a planning session

## Key Responsibilities
1. Define planning session state model
2. Implement state manager class
3. Implement state store for retrieving and storing state
4. Implement state API for managing state
5. Implement process manager for planning process
6. Write comprehensive tests for all components
7. Document the API with JSDoc comments

## Existing Codebase Context
The following files are relevant to your task:
- `src/db/models.ts`: Database models for storing planning sessions
- `src/planning/session-manager.ts`: Planning session manager (to be implemented in the Create Linear Issues from Planning Data task)

## Definition of Done
Your task will be considered complete when:
- All acceptance criteria in the implementation document are met
- The agent can create and initialize planning session state
- The agent can update planning session progress
- The agent can record errors and warnings during planning
- The agent can record the results of planning
- Code is well-documented with JSDoc comments
- Tests are comprehensive and passing
- Pull request is submitted and approved

## Branching and PR Guidelines
- Create a branch named `feature/planning-session-state-management`
- Make your changes in this branch
- Submit a PR to the `dev` branch when complete
- Include a detailed description of your changes in the PR

## Timeline
- Estimated effort: 3 story points
- Expected completion: Within 1 week

## Communication
- If you have questions or need clarification, please comment on your assigned Linear issue
- Provide regular updates on your progress
- Flag any blockers or dependencies as soon as possible

## Dependencies
This task depends on the Create Linear Issues from Planning Data user story. You may need to coordinate with the agent implementing that task to ensure compatibility.

Thank you for your contribution to the Linear Planning Agent project. Your work on planning session state management is critical for tracking the progress of planning sessions and providing feedback to users, which is essential for the agent to function effectively.

The ARCHitect will be available to answer questions and provide guidance throughout the implementation process.
