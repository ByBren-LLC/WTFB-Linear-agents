# Kick-off: Linear SDK Compatibility Layer

## Assignment Overview
You are assigned to create a compatibility layer for the Linear SDK API to resolve integration issues with our recently integrated core functionality. The integrated code uses old Linear SDK patterns that no longer exist in the current SDK version, causing 180+ TypeScript errors.

## Linear Project Information
- **Linear Project**: [WTFB Linear Planning Agent](https://linear.app/wtfb/project/linear-planning-agent)
- **Linear Team**: [Linear Agents Team](https://linear.app/wtfb/team/linear-agents)

## Linear Issue Creation
As part of this task, you should:
1. Create a new issue in the Linear project
2. Set the issue type to "Technical Enabler"
3. Set the priority to "High"
4. Title the issue "Linear SDK Compatibility Layer"
5. Include a brief description referencing this implementation document
6. Add the label "architecture"
7. Assign the issue to yourself

## Implementation Document
Your detailed implementation document is available in the repository:
[Linear SDK Compatibility Layer Implementation](https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents/blob/main/specs/linear_sdk_compatibility_layer-implementation.md)

## Project Context
We recently integrated 22,183 lines of core functionality from three major branches:
- Linear issue operations (create, find, update, mapping)
- Confluence document parsing
- Bidirectional synchronization engine

However, the integrated code uses old Linear SDK API patterns (e.g., `linearClient.issueCreate()`) that don't exist in the current Linear SDK v2.6.0, which uses class-based patterns (e.g., `Issue.create()`).

Your task is to create a compatibility layer that bridges this gap without requiring changes to the integrated business logic. This includes:
- Extending the existing LinearClientWrapper class
- Adding compatibility methods for all Linear SDK operations
- Preserving existing error handling and retry logic
- Maintaining rate limiting functionality

## Key Responsibilities
1. Analyze all Linear SDK API calls in the integrated codebase
2. Create compatibility methods in LinearClientWrapper
3. Implement SDK pattern mapping utilities
4. Preserve existing error handling and retry mechanisms
5. Maintain rate limiting functionality
6. Write comprehensive tests for all compatibility methods
7. Document the compatibility layer with JSDoc comments

## Existing Codebase Context
The following files are relevant to your task:
- `src/linear/client.ts`: Existing LinearClientWrapper with executeQuery method
- `src/linear/issue-creator.ts`: Uses linearClient.issueCreate, issueLabelCreate
- `src/linear/issue-updater.ts`: Uses linearClient.issueUpdate
- `src/safe/pi-planning.ts`: Uses cycleCreate, milestoneCreate, issueRelationCreate
- `src/safe/safe_linear_implementation.ts`: Multiple Linear API calls
- `src/agent/planning.ts`: Uses issueCreate

## Definition of Done
Your task will be considered complete when:
- All acceptance criteria in the implementation document are met
- All 180+ Linear SDK API calls work without modification to existing code
- Existing error handling and retry logic is preserved
- Rate limiting functionality continues to work
- Performance impact is minimal (< 5ms overhead per API call)
- Code is well-documented with JSDoc comments
- Tests are comprehensive and passing (>90% coverage)
- Pull request is submitted and approved

## Branching and PR Guidelines
- Create a branch named `feature/linear-sdk-compatibility-layer`
- Make your changes in this branch
- Submit a PR to the `dev` branch when complete
- Include a detailed description of your changes in the PR

## Timeline
- Estimated effort: 8 story points
- Expected completion: Within 2-3 days

## Communication
- If you have questions or need clarification, please comment on your assigned Linear issue
- Provide regular updates on your progress
- Flag any blockers or dependencies as soon as possible

## Dependencies
This is a critical path item that blocks:
- Module Export Resolution (Agent 2)
- Type Definition Fixes (Agent 3)
- Database Schema Integration (Agent 4)
