## Technical Requirements
### Health Monitoring Components
Your implementation should monitor these key areas:

1. **OAuth Token Health**
   ```typescript
   interface TokenHealthStatus {
     linearToken: {
       expiresAt: Date;
       daysUntilExpiration: number;
       isHealthy: boolean;
       lastRefresh: Date;
     };
     confluenceToken: {
       expiresAt: Date;
       daysUntilExpiration: number;
       isHealthy: boolean;
       lastRefresh: Date;
     };
   }
   ```

2. **API Rate Limit Monitoring**
   ```typescript
   interface APIHealthStatus {
     linear: {
       remainingCalls: number;
       totalCalls: number;
       resetTime: Date;
       usagePercentage: number;
       isHealthy: boolean;
     };
     confluence: {
       remainingCalls: number;
       totalCalls: number;
       resetTime: Date;
       usagePercentage: number;
       isHealthy: boolean;
     };
   }
   ```

3. **System Resource Monitoring**
   ```typescript
   interface ResourceHealthStatus {
     database: {
       connectionCount: number;
       maxConnections: number;
       responseTime: number;
       isHealthy: boolean;
     };
     memory: {
       usedMB: number;
       totalMB: number;
       usagePercentage: number;
       isHealthy: boolean;
     };
     disk: {
       usedGB: number;
       totalGB: number;
       usagePercentage: number;
       isHealthy: boolean;
     };
   }
   ```

### Notification Content Examples
Your notifications should be formatted like:

**OAuth Token Warning:**
```
⚠️ OAuth Token Expiring Soon
🔑 Confluence OAuth token expires in 3 days
📅 Expiration: 2025-01-30 14:30 UTC
⚡ Action needed: Refresh token or re-authenticate
🔧 Command: npm run auth:refresh confluence
```

**API Rate Limit Warning:**
```
🚨 API Rate Limit Warning
📊 Linear API usage: 850/1000 calls (85%)
⏰ Resets in: 2 hours 15 minutes
💡 Consider reducing sync frequency or batching operations
📈 Current rate: 12 calls/minute
```

**Resource Usage Alert:**
```
💾 High Memory Usage Alert
📊 Memory usage: 1.7GB/2GB (85%)
🔄 Database connections: 18/20 (90%)
💡 Consider restarting service or scaling resources
📋 Top consumers: Sync operations, webhook processing
```

### System Health Dashboard Vision

Your implementation should work toward this aggregate health dashboard view:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                 System Health Dashboard                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ OAuth Tokens:  Linear ✅ (45d) │ Confluence ⚠️ (3d)        │
│ API Usage:     Linear 70% ████▒▒ │ Confluence 40% ██▒▒▒▒   │
│ Resources:     Memory 85% ████▒ ⚠️ │ DB Conn 50% ██▒▒▒    │
│ Operations:    Sync ✅ (2m ago)  │ Planning ✅ (5m ago)    │
│ Disk Space:    Data 60% ███▒▒▒   │ Logs 30% █▒▒▒▒▒       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Overall Status: ⚠️  DEGRADED - Memory usage high           │
│ Last Check: 2025-01-27 14:30:15 UTC                        │
│ Next Check: 2025-01-27 14:35:15 UTC                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Health Endpoint: GET /api/health
- 🟢 Healthy (< 80% all metrics)
- 🟡 Degraded (80-90% any metric)
- 🔴 Critical (> 90% any metric)
```

This dashboard helps agents understand:
- **At-a-glance status** of all system components
- **Visual indicators** for quick problem identification
- **Trend information** (time since last events)
- **Actionable status** (what needs attention)
- **Predictive warnings** (before issues become critical)

## Definition of Done
Your task will be considered complete when:
- All acceptance criteria in the implementation document are met
- OAuth token health monitoring is implemented and tested
- API rate limit monitoring provides accurate usage tracking
- System resource monitoring covers memory, disk, and database
- Budget monitoring tracks API usage against configured limits
- Health check endpoint provides comprehensive system status
- Alert processing includes throttling and actionable guidance
- Comprehensive tests validate all monitoring scenarios
- Documentation covers setup, configuration, and troubleshooting
- Code follows project coding standards
- Minimal performance impact on core operations

## Implementation Steps
1. **Create health monitoring data structures** and configuration types
2. **Implement OAuth token health monitoring** with expiration tracking
3. **Implement API rate limit monitoring** for Linear and Confluence
4. **Implement system resource monitoring** (memory, disk, database)
5. **Create budget monitoring** for API usage tracking
6. **Implement health check endpoint** for external monitoring
7. **Add alert processing and notification logic** with throttling
8. **Create comprehensive tests** for all monitoring scenarios

- Test API rate limit monitoring accuracy
- Test resource usage monitoring and alerting
- Test health check endpoint responses

### Manual Testing
- Simulate OAuth token expiration scenarios
- Test API rate limit threshold crossing

## Communication Protocol
- **Questions**: Comment on your assigned Linear issue
- **Progress Updates**: Update Linear issue status and provide regular progress comments
- **Blockers**: Flag any blockers or dependencies immediately in Linear issue
- **Code Reviews**: Request review from team members when ready

## Dependencies
This story has the following dependencies:
- **Enhanced SlackNotifier**: Must be completed first (blocking dependency)
- **OAuth Implementation**: Already implemented and ready for monitoring
- **API Clients**: Already implemented with rate limit information available
- **Database Models**: Already implemented and ready for resource monitoring

## Timeline and Effort
- **Story Points**: 5
- **Estimated Timeline**: 1 week
- **Complexity**: Medium-High (comprehensive monitoring implementation)

## Success Criteria
The story will be successful when:
1. **Proactive Monitoring**: Issues are detected and alerted before they become critical
2. **Actionable Alerts**: Notifications provide clear guidance for issue resolution
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All critical system components are monitored
4. **Performance**: Minimal impact on core planning agent functionality
5. **Reliability**: Monitoring system is robust and doesn't create additional issues

## Security Considerations
- Health monitoring should not expose sensitive system information
- OAuth token monitoring should not log actual token values
- Health check endpoint should require authentication for detailed information
- Alert notifications should not include sensitive configuration details

## Quality Standards
- All code must follow project TypeScript and coding standards
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests required
- Documentation must include configuration examples and troubleshooting guidance
- Error handling must be robust and not affect core functionality
- Performance impact must be minimal and measured
