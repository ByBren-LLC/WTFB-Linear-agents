# Kick-off: Database Schema Design Implementation

## Assignment Overview
You are assigned to implement the Database Schema Design technical enabler for the Linear Planning Agent project. This is a foundational component that will enable data persistence for the agent.

## Linear Project Information
- **Linear Project**: [SAFe Agents](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/project/safe-agents-41505bde79df/overview)
- **Linear Team**: [Linear Agents](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/team/LIN/all)
- **Issue Type**: Technical Enabler
- **Priority**: High

## Implementation Document
Your detailed implementation document is available in the repository:
[Database Schema Design Implementation](https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents/blob/main/specs/database_schema_design-implementation.md)

## Project Context
The Linear Planning Agent will serve as a SAFe Technical Delivery Manager (TDM) within Linear.app, bridging high-level planning and task execution. This agent will analyze Confluence documentation, create properly structured Linear issues, and maintain SAFe hierarchy and relationships.

Your task is to design and implement the database schema that will store:
- OAuth tokens for Linear authentication
- Planning session information
- Relationships between planning entities (Epics, Features, Stories, Enablers)

## Key Responsibilities
1. Create the database migration system
2. Define the database schema with all necessary tables
3. Implement TypeScript interfaces for the database models
4. Implement CRUD operations for each table
5. Enhance connection management for better performance
6. Add appropriate indexes for performance optimization

## Existing Codebase Context
The following files are relevant to your task:
- `src/db/connection.ts`: Basic database connection setup using PostgreSQL
- `src/db/models.ts`: Placeholder for database models
- `src/auth/tokens.ts`: Currently uses in-memory storage for tokens
- `src/auth/oauth.ts`: OAuth implementation that needs database integration

## Definition of Done
Your task will be considered complete when:
- All acceptance criteria in the implementation document are met
- Database schema is properly designed and implemented
- Migrations are implemented and tested
- CRUD operations are implemented and tested
- Code is well-documented
- Pull request is submitted and approved

## Branching and PR Guidelines
- Create a branch named `feature/database-schema-design`
- Make your changes in this branch
- Submit a PR to the `dev` branch when complete
- Include a detailed description of your changes in the PR

## Timeline
- Estimated effort: 3 story points
- Expected completion: Within 1 week

## Communication
- If you have questions or need clarification, please comment on your assigned Linear issue
- Provide regular updates on your progress
- Flag any blockers or dependencies as soon as possible

Thank you for your contribution to the Linear Planning Agent project. Your work on the database schema is critical to the success of the project as it provides the foundation for data persistence.

The ARCHitect will be available to answer questions and provide guidance throughout the implementation process.
