## User Story: Enhanced SlackNotifier for Operational Intelligence

As a development team member, I want an enhanced SlackNotifier with operational intelligence methods, so that I can receive detailed notifications about planning operations, system health, and workflow status.

### Scope
Extend existing SlackNotifier with:
- Planning statistics notifications (epic/feature/story counts, duration)
- Sync status notifications (conflict counts, resolution details)
- System health notifications (component status, actionable details)
- Budget and resource notifications (usage percentages, limits)
- Workflow notifications (agent assignments, PR status)

### Implementation Document
[Enhanced SlackNotifier Story](https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents/blob/main/specs/enhanced-slack-notifier-story.md)

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Enhanced SlackNotifier extends existing SlackNotifier without breaking changes
- [ ] Planning statistics notifications include comprehensive metrics
- [ ] System health notifications include actionable guidance
- [ ] Configuration allows enabling/disabling notification types
- [ ] All notifications are distinct from Linear's issue notifications
- [ ] Comprehensive testing validates all notification methods
```

### Linking Instructions

After creating the issue:

1. Link to the parent Technical Enabler issue (Agent Operations Slack Integration)
2. Link to any existing SlackNotifier or notification-related issues

## Project Context

The Linear Planning Agent currently has a well-implemented SlackNotifier class (`src/integrations/slack.ts`) but it's not integrated into the application workflows. Your task is to enhance this foundation with operational intelligence methods that provide valuable insights beyond Linear's existing issue notifications.

## Implementation Document

Read the detailed implementation document: [Enhanced SlackNotifier Story](https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents/blob/dev/specs/todo/enhanced-slack-notifier-story.md)

This document contains:

- Complete technical analysis of existing SlackNotifier
- Detailed enhancement plan and new methods
- Notification content examples and formatting
- Testing approach and acceptance criteria

## Key Files and Components

You'll be working with these key files:

### Existing Files to Understand

- `src/integrations/slack.ts`: Current SlackNotifier implementation (foundation)
- `.env.template`: Slack webhook URL configuration
- `src/utils/logger.ts`: Logging patterns used by SlackNotifier

### Files to Create/Modify

- `src/integrations/enhanced-slack-notifier.ts`: Enhanced SlackNotifier implementation
- `src/types/notification-types.ts`: TypeScript interfaces for notification data
- `src/integrations/slack.ts`: Minor modifications if needed for extensibility

## Technical Requirements

### Enhanced Notification Methods

Your implementation should include these operational intelligence methods:

1. **Planning Statistics**

   ```typescript
   async sendPlanningStatistics(stats: PlanningStatistics): Promise<boolean>
   ```

2. **Sync Status Updates**

   ```typescript
   async sendSyncStatusUpdate(syncResult: SyncResult): Promise<boolean>
   ```

3. **System Health Alerts**

   ```typescript
   async sendSystemHealthAlert(health: SystemHealth): Promise<boolean>
   ```

4. **Budget and Resource Alerts**

   ```typescript
   async sendBudgetAlert(budget: BudgetAlert): Promise<boolean>
   ```

5. **Workflow Notifications**

   ```typescript
   async sendWorkflowNotification(workflow: WorkflowEvent): Promise<boolean>
   ```

### Configuration Management

Implement configuration for:

- Enabling/disabling different notification types
- Channel routing for different notification categories
- Throttling to prevent notification spam

### Notification Content Examples

Your notifications should be formatted like:

**Planning Statistics:**

```
üìä Planning Completed: "Q1 2025 Planning"
‚úÖ Created: 1 Epic, 5 Features, 23 Stories, 3 Enablers
‚è±Ô∏è Duration: 2.3 minutes
üìÑ Source: Confluence Page "Q1 Planning Document"
```

**System Health Alert:**

```
üö® System Alert: OAuth Token Expiring
üîë Confluence OAuth expires in 24 hours
‚ö° Action needed: Refresh token or re-authenticate
üìç Component: Confluence API Integration
```

## Definition of Done

Your task will be considered complete when:

- All acceptance criteria in the implementation document are met
- Enhanced SlackNotifier extends existing SlackNotifier without breaking changes
- All operational intelligence notification methods are implemented
- Notification formatting is clear, actionable, and informative
- Configuration management allows fine-grained control of notifications
- Throttling prevents notification spam
- Comprehensive unit tests validate all functionality
- Integration tests confirm compatibility with existing SlackNotifier
- Documentation covers setup, configuration, and usage
- Code follows project coding standards
- No performance impact on core operations

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create notification type definitions** in `src/types/notification-types.ts`
2. **Implement EnhancedSlackNotifier class** extending base SlackNotifier
3. **Add operational intelligence notification methods** with proper formatting
4. **Implement configuration management** for notification types and channels
5. **Add throttling mechanism** to prevent notification spam
6. **Create comprehensive unit tests** for all notification methods
7. **Test integration** with existing SlackNotifier usage
8. **Validate notification formatting** and content quality
9. **Document configuration options** and usage examples
10. **Performance test** to ensure minimal impact on core operations

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests Required

- Test each enhanced notification method with mock data
- Test notification formatting produces expected output
- Test configuration management enables/disables notifications correctly
- Test throttling prevents excessive notifications
- Test error handling gracefully handles Slack API failures

### Integration Tests Required

- Test EnhancedSlackNotifier extends SlackNotifier correctly
- Test notification content matches expected format and structure
- Test configuration changes affect notification behavior

### Manual Testing

- Verify notifications appear in Slack with correct formatting
- Confirm notifications are actionable and informative
- Test different configuration scenarios

## Communication Protocol

- **Questions**: Comment on your assigned Linear issue
- **Progress Updates**: Update Linear issue status and provide regular progress comments
- **Blockers**: Flag any blockers or dependencies immediately in Linear issue
- **Code Reviews**: Request review from team members when ready

## Dependencies

This story has the following dependencies:

- **Existing SlackNotifier**: Already implemented in `src/integrations/slack.ts`
- **Environment Configuration**: Slack webhook URL already configured
- **No blocking dependencies**: Can be implemented independently

## Timeline and Effort

- **Story Points**: 3
- **Estimated Timeline**: 3-4 days
- **Complexity**: Medium (extending existing implementation)

## Success Criteria

The story will be successful when:

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing SlackNotifier usage continues to work
2. **Enhanced Functionality**: New operational intelligence methods are available
3. **Clear Value**: Notifications provide actionable insights for operations teams
4. **Quality**: Code meets project standards with comprehensive testing
5. **Documentation**: Setup and usage are clearly documented

## Security Considerations

- Notification content must not include sensitive data (tokens, credentials)
- Configuration should allow disabling notifications in security-sensitive environments
- Error messages in notifications should not expose internal system details

## Quality Standards

- All code must follow project TypeScript and coding standards
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests required
- Documentation must include configuration examples and usage guidance
- Error handling must be robust and not affect core functionality
- Performance impact must be minimal
