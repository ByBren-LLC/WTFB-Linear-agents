# Kick-off: SAFe Implementation in Linear Spike

## Assignment Overview
You are assigned to conduct the SAFe Implementation in Linear spike for the Linear Planning Agent project. This research task will inform how we implement SAFe methodology in Linear.

## Linear Project Information
- **Linear Project**: [SAFe Agents](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/project/safe-agents-41505bde79df/overview)
- **Linear Team**: [Linear Agents](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/team/LIN/all)
- **Issue Type**: Spike
- **Priority**: High

## Implementation Document
Your detailed implementation document is available in the repository:
[SAFe Implementation in Linear Implementation](https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents/blob/main/specs/safe_implementation_in_linear-implementation.md)

## Project Context
The Linear Planning Agent will serve as a SAFe Technical Delivery Manager (TDM) within Linear.app, bridging high-level planning and task execution. This agent will analyze Confluence documentation, create properly structured Linear issues, and maintain SAFe hierarchy and relationships.

Your task is to research and document the optimal approach for implementing SAFe methodology in Linear, including:
- Mapping SAFe concepts (Epics, Features, Stories, Enablers) to Linear entities
- Establishing naming conventions, labeling strategies, and relationship management
- Documenting best practices for maintaining SAFe compliance in Linear

## Key Responsibilities
1. Research SAFe methodology and Linear capabilities
2. Explore different approaches for representing SAFe hierarchy in Linear
3. Test different strategies for managing relationships between SAFe work items
4. Evaluate labeling and categorization strategies
5. Document findings and recommendations
6. Create examples and code snippets for implementation

## Existing Codebase Context
The following files are relevant to your task:
- `src/safe/hierarchy.ts`: Contains SAFe hierarchy management
- `src/safe/pi-planning.ts`: Contains Program Increment planning
- `src/safe/enablers.ts`: Contains Technical Enabler management
- `src/agent/planning.ts`: Contains planning logic

## Definition of Done
Your task will be considered complete when:
- The question has been answered with sufficient detail
- Clear mapping of SAFe concepts to Linear entities is documented
- Recommendations for labels, statuses, and relationships are provided
- Examples of SAFe workflows in Linear are documented
- Guidelines for implementing SAFe hierarchy in the Planning Agent are provided
- Best practices for maintaining SAFe compliance in Linear are documented
- Knowledge has been transferred to the team
- Next steps for implementation are clearly defined

## Deliverables
- A comprehensive document detailing your findings and recommendations
- Code examples for implementing SAFe concepts in Linear
- Visual representations of SAFe hierarchy in Linear
- Recommendations for the Planning Agent implementation

## Branching and PR Guidelines
- Create a branch named `spike/safe-implementation-in-linear`
- Document your findings in a Markdown file
- Submit a PR to the `dev` branch when complete
- Include a detailed summary of your findings in the PR

## Timeline
- Time-Box: 2 days
- Expected completion: Within 1 week

## Communication
- If you have questions or need clarification, please comment on your assigned Linear issue
- Provide regular updates on your progress
- Flag any blockers or dependencies as soon as possible
