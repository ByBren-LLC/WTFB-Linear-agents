# Kick-off: Type Definition Fixes

## Assignment Overview
You are assigned to resolve TypeScript type definition issues that are preventing compilation of the integrated Confluence parsing functionality and other components. This includes fixing Cheerio import issues and resolving interface mismatches.

## Linear Project Information
- **Linear Project**: [WTFB Linear Planning Agent](https://linear.app/wtfb/project/linear-planning-agent)
- **Linear Team**: [Linear Agents Team](https://linear.app/wtfb/team/linear-agents)

## Linear Issue Creation
As part of this task, you should:
1. Create a new issue in the Linear project
2. Set the issue type to "Technical Enabler"
3. Set the priority to "Medium"
4. Title the issue "Type Definition Fixes"
5. Include a brief description referencing this implementation document
6. Add the label "technical-debt"
7. Assign the issue to yourself

## Implementation Document
Your detailed implementation document is available in the repository:
[Type Definition Fixes Implementation](https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents/blob/main/specs/type_definition_fixes-implementation.md)

## Project Context
The integration of Confluence parsing functionality brought in code that uses Cheerio for HTML parsing, but the current Cheerio version has different type exports than expected. Additionally, there are interface mismatches and type conflicts that need resolution.

Your task is to resolve these type definition issues to enable proper TypeScript compilation. This includes:
- Fixing Cheerio Element import issues
- Resolving interface mismatches between components
- Maintaining type safety throughout the codebase
- Ensuring proper error handling types

## Key Responsibilities
1. Research correct Cheerio type imports for current version
2. Fix Cheerio Element imports in all Confluence parsing files
3. Resolve interface mismatches between integrated components
4. Fix type assertion issues in error handlers
5. Add proper uuid type imports where needed
6. Create custom type definitions if necessary
7. Test compilation and verify functionality

## Existing Codebase Context
The following files are relevant to your task:
- `src/confluence/element-parsers.ts`: Cheerio Element import issues
- `src/confluence/macro-handlers.ts`: Cheerio Element import issues
- `src/confluence/parser.ts`: Cheerio Element import issues
- `src/confluence/error-handler.ts`: Type assertion issues
- `src/planning/structure-analyzer.ts`: Missing uuid types

## Definition of Done
Your task will be considered complete when:
- All acceptance criteria in the implementation document are met
- TypeScript compilation succeeds for all affected files
- All Cheerio import issues are resolved
- Interface mismatches are fixed
- Type safety is maintained throughout
- No any types introduced as workarounds
- Tests pass for all affected functionality
- Pull request is submitted and approved

## Branching and PR Guidelines
- Create a branch named `feature/type-definition-fixes`
- Make your changes in this branch
- Submit a PR to the `dev` branch when complete
- Include a detailed description of your changes in the PR

## Timeline
- Estimated effort: 3 story points
- Expected completion: Within 1 day

## Communication
- If you have questions or need clarification, please comment on your assigned Linear issue
- Provide regular updates on your progress
- Flag any blockers or dependencies as soon as possible

## Dependencies
- Should be started after Module Export Resolution (Agent 2) is in progress
- Can work in parallel with Database Schema Integration (Agent 4)
- Requires Linear SDK Compatibility Layer (Agent 1) to be complete
