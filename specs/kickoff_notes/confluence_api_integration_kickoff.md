# Kick-off: Confluence API Integration

## Assignment Overview
You are assigned to implement the Confluence API Integration technical enabler for the Linear Planning Agent project. This is a foundational component that will enable the agent to read planning documents from Confluence.

## Linear Project Information
- **Linear Project**: [SAFe Agents](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/project/safe-agents-41505bde79df/overview)
- **Linear Team**: [Linear Agents](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/team/LIN/all)

## Linear Issue Creation
As part of this task, you should:
1. Create a new issue in the Linear project
2. Set the issue type to "Technical Enabler"
3. Set the priority to "High"
4. Title the issue "Confluence API Integration"
5. Include a brief description referencing this implementation document
6. Add the label "api-integration"
7. Assign the issue to yourself

## Implementation Document
Your detailed implementation document is available in the repository:
[Confluence API Integration Implementation](https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents/blob/main/specs/confluence_api_integration-implementation.md)

## Project Context
The Linear Planning Agent will serve as a SAFe Technical Delivery Manager (TDM) within Linear.app, bridging high-level planning and task execution. This agent will analyze Confluence documentation, create properly structured Linear issues, and maintain SAFe hierarchy and relationships.

Your task is to implement the integration with the Confluence API to enable the Linear Planning Agent to read planning documents from Confluence. This includes:
- Implementing a Confluence API client
- Implementing OAuth flow for Confluence authentication
- Implementing rate limiting and error handling
- Implementing utility functions for common Confluence operations

## Key Responsibilities
1. Implement a Confluence API client class
2. Implement OAuth flow for Confluence authentication
3. Update database schema to store Confluence tokens
4. Implement rate limiting to respect Confluence API limits
5. Implement error handling for API errors
6. Implement utility functions for common Confluence operations
7. Write comprehensive tests for all components

## Existing Codebase Context
The following files are relevant to your task:
- `src/auth/tokens.ts`: Token management for Linear OAuth
- `src/db/models.ts`: Database models for storing tokens and planning sessions
- `src/utils/encryption.ts`: Utilities for encrypting sensitive data

## Definition of Done
Your task will be considered complete when:
- All acceptance criteria in the implementation document are met
- The agent can authenticate with the Confluence API using OAuth
- The agent can retrieve Confluence pages and attachments
- The agent handles API rate limits and errors appropriately
- Code is well-documented with JSDoc comments
- Tests are comprehensive and passing
- Pull request is submitted and approved

## Branching and PR Guidelines
- Create a branch named `feature/confluence-api-integration`
- Make your changes in this branch
- Submit a PR to the `dev` branch when complete
- Include a detailed description of your changes in the PR

## Timeline
- Estimated effort: 3 story points
- Expected completion: Within 1 week

## Communication
- If you have questions or need clarification, please comment on your assigned Linear issue
- Provide regular updates on your progress
- Flag any blockers or dependencies as soon as possible
