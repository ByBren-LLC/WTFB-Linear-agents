# TODO Archive - Pre-TypeScript Coordination (2025-07-08)

**Archive Date**: July 8, 2025
**Reason**: Archived before TypeScript strict mode compliance 4-agent coordination
**Status**: These items were superseded by critical TypeScript infrastructure fixes

## Archived Items

The following TODO items were archived when we pivoted to critical TypeScript strict mode compliance:

- `agent-command-understanding.md`
- `agent-workflow-planner-confluence-planning.md`
- `agile-release-train-planning-story.md`
- `dependency-mapping-system-story.md`
- `lin-49-phase-2-value-delivery-validation.md`

- `linear-agent-core-capabilities.md`
- `story-decomposition-engine-story.md`
- `system-health-monitoring-story.md`
- `webhook-processors-implementation.md`

## Context

These items represent previous planning work that was superseded by the urgent need to fix TypeScript strict mode compliance issues blocking all tests and builds.

## Future Consideration

After TypeScript infrastructure is restored, these items may be reconsidered for future development cycles.
