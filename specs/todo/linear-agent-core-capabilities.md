# Linear Agent Core Capabilities Implementation

**Epic**: Linear Agent Interactive Capabilities  
**Priority**: High (1) - Core Linear agent functionality  
**Total Story Points**: 21 points across 4 stories  
**Dependencies**: None (can be implemented without breaking changes)

## 📋 **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

The SAFe PULSE Linear agent currently has excellent CLI and API capabilities but lacks the **core interactive agent functionality** required by Linear's agent specification. This epic implements the missing capabilities to transform the agent from a CLI tool into a true Linear workspace agent.

**Business Value**: Enables users to interact with the sophisticated ART planning system directly within Linear through mentions, commands, and autonomous behaviors.

## 🎯 **MISSING CAPABILITIES ANALYSIS**

### **✅ What We Have (Strong Foundation)**
- **OAuth Integration**: Proper Linear authentication with `actor=app`
- **Webhook Infrastructure**: Basic webhook handling and signature verification
- **Response Templates**: Agent communication patterns in `src/agent/responses.ts`
- **Slack Integration**: Operational notification system
- **Sophisticated Backend**: 6,649+ lines of ART planning capabilities
- **Linear API Integration**: Comprehensive Linear client wrapper

### **❌ What's Missing (Core Agent Features)**
1. **Mention Processing** - No actual @saafepulse mention handling
2. **Command Understanding** - No natural language processing for agent commands
3. **Autonomous Actions** - No proactive agent behaviors
4. **Webhook Processors** - Placeholder implementations only

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE**

### **Integration with Existing System**
```typescript
// Enhanced webhook handler integration
// src/webhooks/handler.ts (enhanced)
export const handleWebhook = async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  // Existing signature verification (✅ already implemented)
  
  switch (type) {
    case 'AppUserNotification':
      // NEW: Route to specific processors
      await routeToProcessor(req.body);
      break;
  }
};

// NEW: Processor routing system
async function routeToProcessor(payload: AppUserNotification) {
  const processor = ProcessorFactory.create(payload.action);
  await processor.process(payload);
}
```

### **Command Parser Architecture**
```typescript
// src/agent/command-parser.ts (NEW)
export class AgentCommandParser {
  parseCommand(text: string, context: IssueContext): ParsedCommand {
    // Natural language processing
    // Intent recognition
    // Parameter extraction
    // Context awareness
  }
}

// Integration with ART planning
export class ARTCommandExecutor {
  async executeCommand(command: ParsedCommand): Promise<AgentResponse> {
    // Route to appropriate ART planning CLI command
    // Execute with proper parameters
    // Format response for Linear
  }
}
```
