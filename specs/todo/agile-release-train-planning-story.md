# User Story: Agile Release Train (ART) Planning and Story Decomposition

## Story Overview

**As a** SAFe Technical Delivery Manager (TDM)  
**I want** comprehensive Agile Release Train (ART) planning capabilities with automatic story decomposition and dependency mapping  
**So that** I can ensure each sprint/iteration delivers working software with proper dependency management and value delivery validation

## Business Value

This story addresses a critical gap in the Linear Planning Agent's SAFe implementation. Currently, the agent can create PI planning and extract stories, but lacks the sophisticated ART planning capabilities needed to:

1. **Decompose large stories** (>5 story points) into implementable sub-stories
2. **Map dependencies** between stories and features across iterations
3. **Plan sprint/cycle allocation** ensuring deliverable value each iteration
4. **Validate ART readiness** before PI execution
5. **Score and prioritize** work items for optimal flow

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Story Decomposition Engine
- [ ] **GIVEN** a story with >5 story points
- [ ] **WHEN** the planning agent processes the story
- [ ] **THEN** it automatically decomposes the story into sub-stories of ≤5 points each
- [ ] **AND** maintains traceability to the parent story
- [ ] **AND** preserves acceptance criteria distribution across sub-stories
- [ ] **AND** creates proper Linear issue relationships (parent/child)

### AC2: Dependency Mapping and Analysis
- [ ] **GIVEN** a set of features and stories in a PI
- [ ] **WHEN** the ART planning process runs
- [ ] **THEN** it identifies all dependencies between work items
- [ ] **AND** creates dependency relationships in Linear (blocks/blocked-by)
- [ ] **AND** validates dependency chains for circular dependencies
- [ ] **AND** calculates critical path for feature delivery

### AC3: Sprint/Cycle Planning with Value Delivery
- [ ] **GIVEN** decomposed stories with mapped dependencies
- [ ] **WHEN** planning sprints/cycles within a PI
- [ ] **THEN** it allocates stories to iterations ensuring deliverable value
- [ ] **AND** respects dependency ordering (no story before its dependencies)
- [ ] **AND** balances team capacity across iterations
- [ ] **AND** ensures each iteration can deliver working software

### AC4: ART Readiness Validation
- [ ] **GIVEN** a planned PI with allocated stories
- [ ] **WHEN** validating ART readiness
- [ ] **THEN** it verifies all stories ≤5 points
- [ ] **AND** confirms all dependencies are mapped and resolvable
- [ ] **AND** validates each iteration has deliverable value
- [ ] **AND** identifies any planning risks or blockers

### AC5: Story Scoring and Prioritization
- [ ] **GIVEN** features and stories in the planning backlog
- [ ] **WHEN** the scoring engine runs
- [ ] **THEN** it calculates business value scores for each item
- [ ] **AND** applies WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First) prioritization
- [ ] **AND** considers technical dependencies in prioritization
- [ ] **AND** updates Linear issue priorities accordingly

## Technical Design

### Core Components

#### 1. StoryDecompositionEngine
```typescript
export class StoryDecompositionEngine {
  async decomposeStory(story: Story): Promise<Story[]> {
    // Analyze story complexity and acceptance criteria
    // Break down into logical sub-stories ≤5 points
    // Maintain traceability and relationships
  }
  
  private calculateSubStoryPoints(parentPoints: number, subStories: number): number[] {
    // Distribute points across sub-stories
  }
  
  private distributeAcceptanceCriteria(criteria: string[], subStories: Story[]): void {
    // Distribute AC across sub-stories logically
  }
}
```

#### 2. DependencyMapper
```typescript
export class DependencyMapper {
  async mapDependencies(features: Feature[], stories: Story[]): Promise<DependencyGraph> {
    // Analyze technical and business dependencies
    // Create dependency relationships in Linear
    // Validate for circular dependencies
  }
  
  async calculateCriticalPath(dependencies: DependencyGraph): Promise<CriticalPath> {
    // Calculate critical path for feature delivery
  }
}
```

#### 3. ARTPlanner
```typescript
export class ARTPlanner {
  async planIterations(pi: ProgramIncrement, stories: Story[]): Promise<IterationPlan[]> {
    // Allocate stories to iterations
    // Ensure deliverable value each iteration
    // Respect dependencies and team capacity
  }
  
  async validateARTReadiness(plan: IterationPlan[]): Promise<ARTValidationResult> {
    // Validate planning completeness and quality
  }
}
```

#### 4. StoryScorer
```typescript
export class StoryScorer {
  async scoreStories(stories: Story[]): Promise<ScoredStory[]> {
    // Calculate business value scores
    // Apply WSJF prioritization
    // Consider technical dependencies
  }
}
```

### Integration Points

#### Linear API Integration
- Create sub-story issues with proper parent/child relationships
- Set dependency relationships (blocks/blocked-by)
- Update issue priorities based on scoring
- Assign stories to cycles/iterations

#### Existing Components
- **PIManager**: Extend with ART planning capabilities
- **PlanningAgent**: Integrate ART planning into main workflow
- **SAFeLinearImplementation**: Add ART-specific SAFe compliance
