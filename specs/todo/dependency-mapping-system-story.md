# User Story: Dependency Mapping System

## Story Overview

**As a** SAFe Technical Delivery Manager (TDM)  
**I want** an automated dependency mapping system that identifies and manages dependencies between work items  
**So that** I can ensure proper sequencing of work and avoid blocked iterations in the Agile Release Train

## Business Value

This story implements critical dependency management for SAFe planning by automatically identifying technical and business dependencies between features and stories. Proper dependency mapping prevents iteration planning failures, reduces blocked work, and enables critical path optimization for faster value delivery.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Dependency Detection and Analysis
- [ ] **GIVEN** a set of features and stories in a planning document
- [ ] **WHEN** the dependency mapping system analyzes the work items
- [ ] **THEN** it identifies technical dependencies (shared components, APIs, data)
- [ ] **AND** identifies business dependencies (prerequisite features, user flows)
- [ ] **AND** detects implicit dependencies from acceptance criteria and descriptions
- [ ] **AND** scores dependency strength (hard/soft dependencies)

### AC2: Linear Dependency Relationship Creation
- [ ] **GIVEN** identified dependencies between work items
- [ ] **WHEN** creating the dependency relationships
- [ ] **THEN** it creates Linear "blocks/blocked-by" relationships
- [ ] **AND** applies appropriate relationship types (blocks, related, duplicate)
- [ ] **AND** adds dependency metadata and rationale
- [ ] **AND** handles bidirectional relationships correctly

### AC3: Circular Dependency Detection and Resolution
- [ ] **GIVEN** a set of work items with dependencies
- [ ] **WHEN** validating the dependency graph
- [ ] **THEN** it detects circular dependencies in the graph

- [ ] **AND** suggests resolution strategies (break cycles, reorder work)
- [ ] **AND** prevents creation of invalid dependency structures

### AC4: Critical Path Calculation
- [ ] **GIVEN** a complete dependency graph for a PI
- [ ] **WHEN** calculating delivery optimization
- [ ] **THEN** it identifies the critical path for feature delivery
- [ ] **AND** calculates earliest possible completion dates
- [ ] **AND** identifies work items that impact overall timeline
- [ ] **AND** provides optimization recommendations

### AC5: Dependency Impact Analysis
- [ ] **GIVEN** changes to work items or their dependencies
- [ ] **WHEN** analyzing the impact of changes
- [ ] **THEN** it identifies all downstream impacts
- [ ] **AND** calculates timeline implications
- [ ] **AND** identifies affected iterations and features
- [ ] **AND** provides change impact reports

## Technical Design

### Core Component: DependencyMapper

```typescript
export interface DependencyRelationship {
  sourceId: string;
  targetId: string;
  type: 'blocks' | 'blocked_by' | 'related';
  strength: 'hard' | 'soft';
  rationale: string;
  detectionMethod: 'keyword' | 'semantic' | 'manual';
}

export interface DependencyGraph {
  nodes: WorkItem[];
  edges: DependencyRelationship[];
  criticalPath: string[];
  circularDependencies: string[][];
}

export class DependencyMapper {
  /**
   * Analyzes work items and identifies dependencies
   */
  async mapDependencies(workItems: WorkItem[]): Promise<DependencyGraph> {
    // 1. Analyze technical dependencies (APIs, components, data)
    // 2. Analyze business dependencies (user flows, prerequisites)
    // 3. Extract dependencies from acceptance criteria
    // 4. Score dependency strength and importance
    // 5. Build dependency graph
    // 6. Validate for circular dependencies
  }

  /**
   * Detects technical dependencies between work items
   */
  private detectTechnicalDependencies(workItems: WorkItem[]): DependencyRelationship[] {
    // Analyze shared components, APIs, databases
    // Look for common technical terms and patterns
    // Identify infrastructure dependencies
  }

  /**
   * Detects business dependencies from user flows and features
   */
  private detectBusinessDependencies(workItems: WorkItem[]): DependencyRelationship[] {
    // Analyze user story flows and prerequisites
    // Identify feature dependencies
    // Look for business process dependencies
  }

  /**
   * Validates dependency graph for circular dependencies
   */
  private validateDependencyGraph(graph: DependencyGraph): string[][] {
    // Use topological sort to detect cycles
    // Return all circular dependency chains
    // Provide resolution suggestions
  }

  /**
   * Calculates critical path through dependency graph
   */
  private calculateCriticalPath(graph: DependencyGraph): string[] {
    // Use longest path algorithm
    // Consider story points and complexity
    // Return critical path sequence
  }
}
```

### Linear Integration Component

```typescript
export class LinearDependencyManager {
  /**
   * Creates dependency relationships in Linear
   */
  async createDependencyRelationships(
    dependencies: DependencyRelationship[]
  ): Promise<void> {
    // Create Linear issue relationships
    // Handle relationship types appropriately
    // Add metadata and comments
  }

  /**
   * Updates existing dependency relationships
   */
  async updateDependencyRelationships(
    existingDeps: DependencyRelationship[],
    newDeps: DependencyRelationship[]
  ): Promise<void> {
    // Compare existing vs new dependencies
    // Add new relationships
    // Remove obsolete relationships
    // Update changed relationships
  }
}
```

### Dependency Analysis Engine

```typescript
export class DependencyAnalyzer {
  /**
   * Analyzes text content for dependency keywords and patterns
   */
  analyzeDependencyPatterns(content: string): string[] {
    // Look for dependency keywords (requires, depends on, after, before)
    // Identify technical terms (API, database, service names)
    // Extract component and system references
  }

  /**
   * Performs semantic analysis for implicit dependencies
   */
  async performSemanticAnalysis(workItems: WorkItem[]): Promise<DependencyRelationship[]> {
    // Use NLP techniques to identify implicit dependencies
    // Analyze acceptance criteria for sequential requirements
    // Identify shared concepts and entities
  }
}
```
