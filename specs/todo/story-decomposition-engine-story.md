# User Story Implementation: Story Decomposition Engine

## Story Information
- **Story ID**: LIN-47
- **Parent Feature**: Agile Release Train (ART) Planning and Story Decomposition (LIN-46)
- **Story Points**: 3
- **Priority**: High

## Story Description
As a SAFe Technical Delivery Manager (TDM), I want an automated story decomposition engine that breaks down large stories (>5 points) into implementable sub-stories, so that all work items are properly sized for sprint execution and maintain SAFe compliance.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Story Size Detection and Validation
- [ ] **GIVEN** a story with story points assigned
- [ ] **WHEN** the story decomposition engine processes the story
- [ ] **THEN** it identifies stories with >5 story points
- [ ] **AND** flags them for decomposition
- [ ] **AND** logs the detection for audit purposes

### AC2: Automated Story Decomposition
- [ ] **GIVEN** a story with >5 story points
- [ ] **WHEN** the decomposition engine runs
- [ ] **THEN** it breaks the story into 2-4 sub-stories of ≤5 points each
- [ ] **AND** distributes the total points across sub-stories logically
- [ ] **AND** maintains the original story as a parent epic/feature
- [ ] **AND** preserves the original story's business value and intent

### AC3: Acceptance Criteria Distribution
- [ ] **GIVEN** a parent story with multiple acceptance criteria
- [ ] **WHEN** decomposing into sub-stories
- [ ] **THEN** it distributes acceptance criteria across sub-stories logically
- [ ] **AND** ensures each sub-story has clear, testable acceptance criteria
- [ ] **AND** maintains traceability from sub-story AC to parent story AC
- [ ] **AND** ensures complete coverage (no AC is lost)

### AC4: Linear Integration and Relationships
- [ ] **GIVEN** decomposed sub-stories
- [ ] **WHEN** creating issues in Linear
- [ ] **THEN** it creates Linear issues for each sub-story
- [ ] **AND** establishes parent/child relationships in Linear
- [ ] **AND** maintains proper labeling and team assignment
- [ ] **AND** preserves original story metadata where appropriate

### AC5: Traceability and Audit Trail
- [ ] **GIVEN** a decomposed story
- [ ] **WHEN** reviewing the decomposition
- [ ] **THEN** it maintains clear traceability from parent to children
- [ ] **AND** provides decomposition rationale and logic
- [ ] **AND** logs all decomposition actions for audit
- [ ] **AND** allows reconstruction of original story intent

## Technical Context
### Existing Codebase Analysis
The Linear Planning Agent currently has story extraction capabilities in `src/planning/structure-analyzer.ts` and story point detection in `src/planning/pattern-recognition.ts`. The decomposition engine will extend these existing capabilities to automatically break down large stories while maintaining the established patterns for story processing and Linear integration.

### Dependencies
- Linear SDK for issue creation and relationship management
- Existing story models and interfaces in `src/planning/models.ts`
- PlanningAgent integration point in `src/agent/planning.ts`
- Story point extraction logic in `src/planning/pattern-recognition.ts`

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain SAFe compliance with ≤5 point story sizing
- Must preserve business value and intent during decomposition
- Must create proper Linear parent/child relationships
- Must handle rollback scenarios for failed decompositions
- Performance requirement: decomposition must complete within 30 seconds

## Implementation Plan

### Core Component: StoryDecompositionEngine

```typescript
export interface DecompositionResult {
  parentStory: Story;
  subStories: Story[];
  decompositionRationale: string;
  pointsDistribution: number[];
  criteriaMapping: AcceptanceCriteriaMapping[];
}

export interface AcceptanceCriteriaMapping {
  originalCriteria: string;
  targetSubStoryId: string;
  adaptedCriteria: string;
}

export class StoryDecompositionEngine {
  /**
   * Decomposes a large story into implementable sub-stories
   */
  async decomposeStory(story: Story): Promise<DecompositionResult> {
    // 1. Analyze story complexity and content
    // 2. Determine optimal number of sub-stories (2-4)
    // 3. Distribute story points logically
    // 4. Break down acceptance criteria
    // 5. Create sub-story titles and descriptions
    // 6. Maintain business value and intent
  }

  /**
   * Calculates optimal point distribution across sub-stories
   */
  private calculatePointsDistribution(totalPoints: number, subStoryCount: number): number[] {
    // Distribute points ensuring each sub-story is ≤5 points
    // Consider complexity and logical boundaries
  }

  /**
   * Distributes acceptance criteria across sub-stories
   */
  private distributeAcceptanceCriteria(
    criteria: string[], 
    subStories: Story[]
  ): AcceptanceCriteriaMapping[] {
    // Map each AC to appropriate sub-story
    // Adapt language for sub-story context
    // Ensure complete coverage
  }

  /**
   * Generates sub-story titles and descriptions
   */
  private generateSubStoryContent(
    parentStory: Story, 
    subStoryIndex: number, 
    totalSubStories: number
  ): { title: string; description: string } {
    // Create meaningful titles that reflect sub-story scope
    // Generate descriptions that maintain parent story context
  }
}
```

### Integration Points

#### Linear API Integration
```typescript
export class LinearStoryDecomposer {
  async createDecomposedStories(decomposition: DecompositionResult): Promise<LinearIssue[]> {
    // Create Linear issues for each sub-story
    // Establish parent/child relationships
    // Apply proper labels and metadata
  }

  async updateParentStory(parentStory: Story, subStories: LinearIssue[]): Promise<void> {
    // Update parent story to reference sub-stories
    // Change parent story state to reflect decomposition
    // Maintain audit trail
  }
}
```

#### Planning Agent Integration
```typescript
// Extend PlanningAgent to use decomposition engine
export class PlanningAgent {
  private decompositionEngine: StoryDecompositionEngine;
  
  async processStories(stories: Story[]): Promise<Story[]> {
    const processedStories: Story[] = [];
    
    for (const story of stories) {
      if (story.storyPoints && story.storyPoints > 5) {
        const decomposition = await this.decompositionEngine.decomposeStory(story);
        processedStories.push(...decomposition.subStories);
      } else {
        processedStories.push(story);
      }
    }
    
    return processedStories;
  }
}
```
