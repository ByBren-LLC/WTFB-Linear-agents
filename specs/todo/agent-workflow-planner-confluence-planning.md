### Platform Abstraction Strategy

**Configuration-Driven Approach:**

```yaml
# workflow_config.yaml
project_management:
  type: "github"  # github, jira, linear, asana
  api_endpoint: "https://api.github.com"
  labels: ["agent-work", "automation"]

documentation:
  type: "notion"  # notion, confluence, google-docs
  workspace: "your-workspace"
  
messaging:
  type: "slack"   # slack, discord, teams
  webhook_url: "your-webhook"

workflow:
  folders: ["todo", "doing", "done", "blocked"]
  attribution_system: true
```

### Agent Support Matrix

- ✅ **Augment Code Remote** - Full integration
- ✅ **Claude CLI** - Command-line workflow
- ✅ **GitHub Copilot Workspace** - GitHub-native
- ✅ **Cursor AI** - VS Code integration
- ✅ **Any SWE Agent** - Generic assignment templates
