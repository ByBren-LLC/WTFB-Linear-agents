**Parent Story**: LIN-46 (ART Planning and Story Decomposition)
**Priority**: High (1)
**Story Points**: 3
**Timeline**: 3-4 days

## Your Mission

Implement the foundational story decomposition engine that automatically breaks down large stories (>5 points) into implementable sub-stories (â‰¤5 points each) while maintaining SAFe compliance and business value.

## Assignment Details

Please:

1. **Pull the latest code** from the dev branch: <https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents>
2. **Read your kickoff note**: <https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents/blob/dev/specs/kickoff_notes/story_decomposition_engine_kickoff.md>
3. **Review the Linear issue**: LIN-47 (Story Decomposition Engine)
4. **Study the implementation document**: <https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents/blob/dev/specs/todo/story-decomposition-engine-story.md>
5. **Implement in 3 phases** as outlined in the kickoff note
6. **Create branch**: `feature/story-decomposition-engine`
7. **Submit PR when complete**

This is **Sub-Story 1 of 4** in the ART Planning system and enables all other ART planning capabilities.
