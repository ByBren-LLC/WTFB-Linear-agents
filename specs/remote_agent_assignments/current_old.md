## üéØ REMAINING WORK - Agent Assignment

### Agent #1 Assignment: System Health Monitoring with Slack Notifications

# Remote Agent Assignment: System Health Monitoring with Slack Notifications

I'm assigning you to implement the System Health Monitoring with Slack Notifications User Story for our Linear Planning Agent project. This is the **final remaining feature** for the Linear Planning Agent Slack integration work.

**Linear Issue**: LIN-45 - System Health Monitoring with Slack Notifications
**Priority**: Medium
**Story Points**: 5
**Timeline**: 1 week

## Your Mission

Implement comprehensive system health monitoring that provides proactive monitoring of OAuth tokens, API rate limits, system resources, and operational health with Slack notifications.

## Assignment Details

Please:

1. **Pull the latest code** from the dev branch: <https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents>
2. **Read your kickoff note**: <https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents/blob/dev/specs/kickoff_notes/system_health_monitoring_story_kickoff.md>
3. **Review the Linear issue**: LIN-45 (already created)
4. **Study the implementation document**: <https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents/blob/dev/specs/todo/system-health-monitoring-story.md>
5. **Implement according to specifications**
6. **Create branch**: `feature/system-health-monitoring`
7. **Submit PR when complete**

## Key Implementation Areas

- **OAuth Token Monitoring**: Track Linear and Confluence token expiration
- **API Rate Limit Monitoring**: Monitor usage and alert before limits
- **Resource Monitoring**: Memory, disk, database connection monitoring
- **Health Check Endpoint**: `/api/health` endpoint for external monitoring
- **Proactive Notifications**: Early warning system via Slack
- **Configuration Management**: Customizable thresholds and settings

## Dependencies

- ‚úÖ Enhanced SlackNotifier (LIN-37) - COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ Existing OAuth implementation - Available
- ‚úÖ API clients with rate limit info - Available

## Success Criteria

- Proactive monitoring prevents issues before they become critical
- Actionable Slack notifications with clear resolution guidance
- Comprehensive coverage of all critical system components
- Minimal performance impact on core planning operations
- Robust error handling that doesn't create additional issues

This is the **final piece** needed to complete the Linear Planning Agent's operational intelligence capabilities. Please let me know if you have any questions or need clarification on any aspect of the implementation.

## üéØ CRITICAL MISSING CAPABILITY - Agent Assignment

### üéØ ART PLANNING SUB-STORIES - Agent Assignments

**IMPORTANT**: LIN-46 (16 points) has been properly decomposed into 4 implementable sub-stories following SAFe methodology:

### Agent #2 Assignment: Story Decomposition Engine (LIN-47)

# Remote Agent Assignment: Story Decomposition Engine

I'm assigning you to implement the **foundational capability** for our ART Planning system. This is the Story Decomposition Engine that automatically breaks down large stories into implementable sub-stories.

**Linear Issue**: LIN-47 - Story Decomposition Engine
**Parent Story**: LIN-46 (ART Planning and Story Decomposition)
**Priority**: High (1)
**Story Points**: 3
**Timeline**: 3-4 days

## Your Mission

Implement the foundational story decomposition engine that automatically breaks down large stories (>5 points) into implementable sub-stories (‚â§5 points each) while maintaining SAFe compliance and business value.

## Key Capabilities to Implement

### **Story Decomposition Engine** (3 points)
- **Detect** stories with >5 story points and flag for decomposition
- **Decompose** them into 2-4 sub-stories of ‚â§5 points each
- **Distribute** acceptance criteria across sub-stories logically
- **Create** Linear parent/child relationships for traceability
- **Maintain** audit trail and business value preservation

## Why This Is Critical

This is **Sub-Story 1 of 4** in the ART Planning system:
- ‚úÖ **LIN-47**: Story Decomposition Engine (3 points) - **YOUR ASSIGNMENT**
- ‚è≥ **LIN-48**: Dependency Mapping System (5 points) - Depends on LIN-47
- ‚è≥ **LIN-49**: ART Iteration Planning (5 points) - Depends on LIN-47, LIN-48
- ‚è≥ **LIN-50**: Story Scoring and Prioritization (3 points) - Can run parallel

**Your work enables the entire ART planning system!**

## Assignment Details

Please:

1. **Pull the latest code** from the dev branch: <https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents>
2. **Read your kickoff note**: <https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents/blob/dev/specs/kickoff_notes/story_decomposition_engine_kickoff.md>
3. **Review the Linear issue**: LIN-47 (Story Decomposition Engine)
4. **Study the implementation document**: <https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents/blob/dev/specs/todo/story-decomposition-engine-story.md>
5. **Implement in 3 phases** as outlined in the kickoff note
6. **Create branch**: `feature/story-decomposition-engine`
7. **Submit PR when complete**

## Why This Is Critical

Currently, our Linear Planning Agent can:
- ‚úÖ Create PI planning and iterations
- ‚úÖ Extract stories from Confluence documents
- ‚úÖ Maintain SAFe hierarchy (Epic ‚Üí Feature ‚Üí Story)

But it **CANNOT**:
- ‚ùå Break down large stories into implementable pieces
- ‚ùå Map dependencies between work items
- ‚ùå Plan iterations ensuring deliverable value
- ‚ùå Validate ART readiness for PI execution

**This capability is essential for production-ready SAFe implementation!**

## Success Impact

This implementation will:
- Complete the Linear Planning Agent's SAFe capabilities
- Enable sophisticated ART planning scenarios
- Ensure each iteration delivers working software
- Provide dependency management and critical path analysis
- Make the agent production-ready for enterprise SAFe teams

**This is the final major capability needed to complete the Linear Planning Agent!** üöÄ

Please let me know if you have any questions or need clarification on any aspect of this critical implementation.

## Assignment Summary

- **Agent #5**: Agent Operations Slack Integration Technical Enabler (8 story points, 1-2 weeks)
- **Agent #6**: Enhanced SlackNotifier for Operational Intelligence (3 story points, 3-4 days)
- **Agent #7**: Planning Agent Slack Integration (3 story points, 3-4 days, depends on #6)
- **Agent #8**: System Health Monitoring with Slack Notifications (5 story points, 1 week, depends on #6)

**Total Effort**: 19 story points across 4 agents
**Priority**: Medium - Enables operational intelligence and proactive monitoring
**Project**: WTFB Linear Planning Agent
**Methodology**: SAFe Essentials

## Dependencies

- **Agent #6** (Enhanced SlackNotifier) must complete before **Agent #7** and **Agent #8** can begin
- **Agent #5** (Technical Enabler) coordinates overall implementation and integration
- All agents should coordinate through Linear issues and PR reviews

## Key Value Proposition

This implementation provides operational intelligence notifications that complement (not duplicate) Linear's existing Slack integration:

- **Planning Operations**: Bulk planning completion, statistics, failure notifications
- **System Health**: OAuth token expiration, API rate limits, resource usage
- **Workflow Intelligence**: Remote agent status, PR reviews, deployment notifications
- **Proactive Monitoring**: Early warning system for potential issues

The notifications focus on operational intelligence that Linear wouldn't naturally provide, giving teams visibility into the planning agent's health and operations.
