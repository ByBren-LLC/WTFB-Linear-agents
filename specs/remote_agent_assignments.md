# Remote Agent Assignment: Complete Linear SDK Compatibility Layer Fix

**Agent ID**: LIN-SDK-02-S01 - Please include this in all commits and PR descriptions using format: `[Agent-ID: LIN-SDK-02-S01]`

**STATUS**: **ACTIVE** - Taking over from Auggie III who completed architectural foundation work.

**PREVIOUS WORK**:
- Auggie III fixed core constructor patterns and added missing methods
- Reduced TypeScript errors from 266 to 249 (17 errors fixed)
- Created solid architectural foundation with proper type handling
- Branch `feature/linear-sdk-compatibility-fix` already exists with progress

**CURRENT TASK**: Complete the remaining 249 TypeScript errors systematically.

## Your Mission:

1. **Repository**: https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents
2. **Linear Issue**: LIN-20 - Fix Linear SDK Compatibility Layer Integration Issues
3. **Checkout existing branch**: `git checkout feature/linear-sdk-compatibility-fix`
4. **Current status**: 249 TypeScript errors remaining (down from 266)
5. **Systematically fix** all remaining TypeScript errors
6. **Target**: Reduce to <50 errors (focusing on Linear SDK issues)
7. **Test and validate** the compatibility layer works
8. **Update Linear issue** with progress comments
9. **Submit PR** when complete

## Key Areas to Focus:

1. **teamId missing errors** - Add teamId parameter to issueLabelCreate calls
2. **Cheerio Element import issues** - Fix import conflicts
3. **null vs undefined** type mismatches
4. **Missing method implementations**
5. **Database integration issues** (separate from SDK but blocking compilation)

## Success Criteria:

- TypeScript compilation succeeds or <50 errors
- All Linear SDK compatibility layer issues resolved
- Existing code patterns continue to work
- PR submitted with comprehensive testing

This is methodical cleanup work - perfect for systematic agent execution!

## Agent #2 Assignment (ID: LIN-DEBT-01-S01)

# Remote Agent Assignment: Module Export Resolution - CRITICAL UPDATE REQUIRED

**Agent ID**: LIN-DEBT-01-S01 - Please include this in all commits and PR descriptions using format: `[Agent-ID: LIN-DEBT-01-S01]`
**Container ID**: 14537ca2-df46-5bcd-9882-7dbd553b4f88 (for reference only)

🚨 **CRITICAL**: Your PR #60 introduced SQLite conflicts that violate our PostgreSQL-only architecture. Please see the architectural correction comment on your PR.

I'm assigning you to implement the Module Export Resolution Technical Enabler for our Linear Planning Agent project. This is a high priority technical debt component that will resolve missing module exports preventing TypeScript compilation.

Please:
1. Pull the latest code from the dev branch of our repository: https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents
2. Read your kickoff note: https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents/blob/main/specs/kickoff_notes/module_export_resolution_kickoff.md
3. Create a Linear issue as instructed in the kickoff note
4. Study the implementation document referenced in the kickoff note
5. Implement the task according to the specifications
6. Create a branch named `feature/module-export-resolution`
7. Submit a PR when complete

This is a high priority task that should be started after Agent #1 begins work. This resolves 45+ compilation errors from missing exports. Please let me know if you have any questions or need clarification on any aspect of the implementation.

## Agent #3 Assignment (ID: LIN-TYPE-01-S01)

# Remote Agent Assignment: Type Definition Fixes

**Agent ID**: LIN-TYPE-01-S01 - Please include this in all commits and PR descriptions using format: `[Agent-ID: LIN-TYPE-01-S01]`

I'm assigning you to implement the Type Definition Fixes Technical Enabler for our Linear Planning Agent project. This is a medium priority technical debt component that will resolve TypeScript type issues, particularly with Cheerio imports and interface mismatches.

Please:
1. Pull the latest code from the dev branch of our repository: https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents
2. Read your kickoff note: https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents/blob/main/specs/kickoff_notes/type_definition_fixes_kickoff.md
3. Create a Linear issue as instructed in the kickoff note
4. Study the implementation document referenced in the kickoff note
5. Implement the task according to the specifications
6. Create a branch named `feature/type-definition-fixes`
7. Submit a PR when complete

This is a medium priority task that can work in parallel with Agent #4 after Agent #2 is in progress. This resolves Cheerio and type definition issues. Please let me know if you have any questions or need clarification on any aspect of the implementation.

## Agent #4 Assignment (ID: LIN-INFRA-01-S01)

# Remote Agent Assignment: Database Schema Integration - EXCELLENT WORK!

**Agent ID**: LIN-INFRA-01-S01 - Please include this in all commits and PR descriptions using format: `[Agent-ID: LIN-INFRA-01-S01]`
**Container ID**: e1fda62c-8150-5e5a-89d5-c32e089394a1 (for reference only)

✅ **EXCELLENT**: Your PR #61 correctly implemented pure PostgreSQL architecture and resolved the database conflicts perfectly!

I'm assigning you to implement the Database Schema Integration Technical Enabler for our Linear Planning Agent project. This is a medium priority infrastructure component that will resolve database schema conflicts between existing OAuth and new planning/sync schemas.

Please:
1. Pull the latest code from the dev branch of our repository: https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents
2. Read your kickoff note: https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents/blob/main/specs/kickoff_notes/database_schema_integration_kickoff.md
3. Create a Linear issue as instructed in the kickoff note
4. Study the implementation document referenced in the kickoff note
5. Implement the task according to the specifications
6. Create a branch named `feature/database-schema-integration`
7. Submit a PR when complete

This is a medium priority task that can work in parallel with Agent #3 after Agent #2 is in progress. This resolves database schema conflicts and integration issues. Please let me know if you have any questions or need clarification on any aspect of the implementation.
