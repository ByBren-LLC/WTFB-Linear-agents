# Remote Agent Assignment: TypeScript & Linear SDK Compatibility Fixes

I'm assigning you to implement the TypeScript & Linear SDK Compatibility Fixes Technical Enabler for our Linear Planning Agent project. This is a HIGH PRIORITY component that will resolve Docker deployment blockers caused by Linear SDK v2.6.0 interface changes.

Please:
1. Pull the latest code from the dev branch of our repository: https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents
2. Read your kickoff note: https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents/blob/main/specs/kickoff_notes/typescript_linear_sdk_fixes_kickoff.md
3. Create a Linear issue as instructed in the kickoff note (LIN-27 already exists - assign to yourself)
4. Study the implementation document referenced in the kickoff note
5. Implement the task according to the specifications
6. Create a branch named `feature/comprehensive-typescript-linear-sdk-fixes`
7. Submit a PR when complete

This is a HIGH PRIORITY task that blocks Docker deployment. Previous agents (LIN-22, LIN-23, LIN-24, LIN-25) completed successfully, and you are handling the remaining infrastructure issues.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need clarification on any aspect of the implementation.
```

**KICKOFF NOTE NEEDED:**
- Create: `specs/kickoff_notes/typescript_linear_sdk_fixes_kickoff.md`
- Reference: Implementation document with detailed TypeScript patterns
- Linear Issue: LIN-27 (already created)

**IMPLEMENTATION DOCUMENT NEEDED:**
- Create: `specs/implementation_docs/typescript_linear_sdk_fixes.md`
- Include: Specific Linear SDK v2.6.0 patterns and fixes
