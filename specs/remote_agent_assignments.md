## Agent #1 Assignment (ID: TBD)

# Remote Agent Assignment: Linear SDK Compatibility Layer

**Agent ID**: Please include your agent ID in all commits and PR descriptions using format: `[Agent-ID: your-id-here]`

I'm assigning you to implement the Linear SDK Compatibility Layer Technical Enabler for our Linear Planning Agent project. This is a high priority architectural component that will resolve 180+ TypeScript errors caused by Linear SDK API pattern changes after our core functionality integration.

Please:
1. Pull the latest code from the dev branch of our repository: https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents
2. Read your kickoff note: https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents/blob/main/specs/kickoff_notes/linear_sdk_compatibility_layer_kickoff.md
3. Create a Linear issue as instructed in the kickoff note
4. Study the implementation document referenced in the kickoff note
5. Implement the task according to the specifications
6. Create a branch named `feature/linear-sdk-compatibility-layer`
7. Submit a PR when complete

This is a critical path task that blocks all other integration work. The integrated code uses old Linear SDK patterns that need compatibility layer. Please let me know if you have any questions or need clarification on any aspect of the implementation.

## Agent #2 Assignment (ID: 14537ca2-df46-5bcd-9882-7dbd553b4f88)

# Remote Agent Assignment: Module Export Resolution - CRITICAL UPDATE REQUIRED

**Agent ID**: 14537ca2-df46-5bcd-9882-7dbd553b4f88 - Please include this in all commits and PR descriptions using format: `[Agent-ID: 14537ca2-df46-5bcd-9882-7dbd553b4f88]`

ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL**: Your PR #60 introduced SQLite conflicts that violate our PostgreSQL-only architecture. Please see the architectural correction comment on your PR.

I'm assigning you to implement the Module Export Resolution Technical Enabler for our Linear Planning Agent project. This is a high priority technical debt component that will resolve missing module exports preventing TypeScript compilation.

Please:
1. Pull the latest code from the dev branch of our repository: https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents
2. Read your kickoff note: https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents/blob/main/specs/kickoff_notes/module_export_resolution_kickoff.md
3. Create a Linear issue as instructed in the kickoff note
4. Study the implementation document referenced in the kickoff note
5. Implement the task according to the specifications
6. Create a branch named `feature/module-export-resolution`
7. Submit a PR when complete

This is a high priority task that should be started after Agent #1 begins work. This resolves 45+ compilation errors from missing exports. Please let me know if you have any questions or need clarification on any aspect of the implementation.

## Agent #3 Assignment

# Remote Agent Assignment: Type Definition Fixes

I'm assigning you to implement the Type Definition Fixes Technical Enabler for our Linear Planning Agent project. This is a medium priority technical debt component that will resolve TypeScript type issues, particularly with Cheerio imports and interface mismatches.

Please:
1. Pull the latest code from the dev branch of our repository: https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents
2. Read your kickoff note: https://github.com/ByBren-LLC/WTFB-Linear-agents/blob/main/specs/kickoff_notes/type_definition_fixes_kickoff.md
3. Create a Linear issue as instructed in the kickoff note
4. Study the implementation document referenced in the kickoff note
5. Implement the task according to the specifications
6. Create a branch named `feature/type-definition-fixes`
7. Submit a PR when complete

This is a medium priority task that can work in parallel with Agent #4 after Agent #2 is in progress. This resolves Cheerio and type definition issues. Please let me know if you have any questions or need clarification on any aspect of the implementation.
