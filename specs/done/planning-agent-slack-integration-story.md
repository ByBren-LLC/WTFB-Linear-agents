# User Story Implementation: Planning Agent Slack Integration

## Story Information
- **Story ID**: TBD (to be assigned in Linear)
- **Parent Feature**: Agent Operations Slack Integration Technical Enabler
- **Story Points**: 3
- **Priority**: Medium

## Story Description
As a planning team member, I want the Planning Agent to send Slack notifications about planning operations, so that I can stay informed about planning completion, statistics, and any issues without having to monitor logs or Linear directly.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] PlanningAgent integrates EnhancedSlackNotifier for planning operation notifications
- [ ] Planning completion notifications include comprehensive statistics (epics, features, stories, duration)
- [ ] Planning failure notifications include error details and actionable guidance
- [ ] PI Planning notifications include PI creation results and feature assignments
- [ ] Bulk planning operations include progress updates and final statistics
- [ ] All notifications are distinct from Linear's issue creation notifications
- [ ] Error handling ensures notification failures don't affect planning operations
- [ ] Configuration allows enabling/disabling planning notifications
- [ ] Notification content is actionable and informative for planning teams

## Technical Context
### Existing Codebase Analysis
The PlanningAgent has clear integration points for notifications:

**Current PlanningAgent (`src/agent/planning.ts`):**
```typescript
export class PlanningAgent {
  async planFromConfluence(confluencePageUrl: string, planningTitle: string)
  async createProgramIncrementFromConfluence(confluencePageUrl: string, teamId: string)
  private async getDefaultTeam()
}
```

**Integration Points Identified:**
- Planning completion in `planFromConfluence` method
- Planning failures in error handling blocks
- PI creation completion in `createProgramIncrementFromConfluence`
- Bulk operations and statistics tracking

### Dependencies
- **Requires**: Enhanced SlackNotifier implementation (previous story)
- **Integrates with**: Existing PlanningAgent functionality
- **No breaking changes**: Must maintain existing PlanningAgent API

### Technical Constraints
- Must not affect planning operation performance
- Notification failures must not break planning workflows
- Must work with existing logging and error handling patterns
- Should provide value beyond Linear's issue notifications

## Implementation Plan
### Files to Create/Modify
1. **`src/agent/planning.ts`** (MODIFY)
   - Add EnhancedSlackNotifier integration
   - Add planning statistics tracking
   - Integrate notifications into planning workflows

2. **`src/types/planning-types.ts`** (CREATE/MODIFY)
   - Define planning statistics and result types
   - Standardize planning notification data structures

### Key Components/Functions
1. **Planning Statistics Tracking**
   ```typescript
   interface PlanningStatistics {
     planningTitle: string;
     confluencePageUrl: string;
     duration: number;
     epicCount: number;
     featureCount: number;
     storyCount: number;
     enablerCount: number;
     piCount?: number;
     objectiveCount?: number;
     riskCount?: number;
   }
   ```

2. **Enhanced PlanningAgent Methods**
   ```typescript
   private slackNotifier: EnhancedSlackNotifier;
   private startTime: number;
   
   private async sendPlanningStartNotification(title: string, pageUrl: string): Promise<void>
   private async sendPlanningCompleteNotification(stats: PlanningStatistics): Promise<void>
   private async sendPlanningFailureNotification(error: Error, context: string): Promise<void>
   private async sendPICreationNotification(pi: ProgramIncrement, stats: PIStatistics): Promise<void>
   ```

3. **Statistics Collection**
   ```typescript
   private collectPlanningStatistics(results: PlanningResults): PlanningStatistics
   private trackPlanningDuration(): number
   private countCreatedItems(results: PlanningResults): ItemCounts
   ```

### Technical Design
```typescript
export class PlanningAgent {
  private linearClient: LinearClient;
  private confluenceApi: ConfluenceAPI;
  private safeImplementation: SAFeLinearImplementation;
  private piManager: PIManager;
  private slackNotifier: EnhancedSlackNotifier; // NEW
  private planningStartTime: number = 0; // NEW

  constructor(accessToken: string, slackConfig?: NotificationConfig) {
    this.linearClient = new LinearClient({ accessToken });
    this.confluenceApi = new ConfluenceAPI();
    this.safeImplementation = new SAFeLinearImplementation(accessToken);
    this.piManager = new PIManager(accessToken);
    this.slackNotifier = new EnhancedSlackNotifier(slackConfig); // NEW
  }

  async planFromConfluence(confluencePageUrl: string, planningTitle: string) {
    this.planningStartTime = Date.now();
    
    try {
      // Send planning start notification
      await this.sendPlanningStartNotification(planningTitle, confluencePageUrl);
      
      // Existing planning logic...
      const results = await this.executePlanningWorkflow(confluencePageUrl, planningTitle);
      
      // Collect statistics and send completion notification
      const stats = this.collectPlanningStatistics(results, planningTitle, confluencePageUrl);
      await this.sendPlanningCompleteNotification(stats);
      
      return results;
    } catch (error) {
      // Send failure notification
      await this.sendPlanningFailureNotification(error as Error, `Planning: ${planningTitle}`);
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```

### Notification Content Examples
1. **Planning Start Notification**
   ```
   üöÄ Planning Started: "Q1 2025 Planning"
   üìÑ Source: Confluence Page "Q1 Planning Document"
   üë§ Initiated by: Planning Agent

## Testing Approach
### Unit Tests
- Test PlanningAgent integration with EnhancedSlackNotifier
- Test planning statistics collection and calculation
- Test notification content formatting and accuracy
- Test error handling when notifications fail
- Test configuration management for planning notifications

### Integration Tests
- Test end-to-end planning workflow with notifications
- Test PI creation workflow with notifications
- Test planning failure scenarios with error notifications
- Test notification timing and content accuracy

### Manual Testing
- Execute planning operations and verify Slack notifications
- Test different planning scenarios (success, failure, PI creation)
- Verify notification content is accurate and actionable
- Confirm notifications don't duplicate Linear's issue notifications

### Test Data Requirements
- Sample Confluence planning documents
- Mock Linear API responses for issue creation
- Test Slack webhook configurations
- Planning scenarios with different complexity levels

## Implementation Steps
1. **Add EnhancedSlackNotifier to PlanningAgent constructor** with optional configuration
2. **Implement planning statistics tracking** throughout planning workflows
3. **Add planning start notifications** at beginning of planning operations
4. **Integrate completion notifications** with comprehensive statistics
5. **Add failure notifications** with actionable error information
6. **Implement PI creation notifications** with PI-specific statistics
7. **Add configuration management** for planning notification preferences
8. **Create comprehensive tests** for all notification scenarios
9. **Update error handling** to include notification context
10. **Document configuration options** and notification content

## SAFe Considerations
- Provides visibility into planning operations for SAFe teams
- Supports continuous improvement by tracking planning metrics
- Enables proactive issue detection during planning processes
- Complements SAFe ceremonies with operational intelligence
- Supports distributed teams with real-time planning updates

## Security Considerations
- Planning notifications should not include sensitive Confluence content
- Error notifications should not expose internal system details
- Configuration should allow disabling notifications for sensitive environments
- Notification content should be appropriate for team Slack channels

## Performance Considerations
- Notifications are asynchronous and don't block planning operations
- Statistics collection has minimal impact on planning performance
- Failed notifications are logged but don't affect planning results
- Notification formatting is efficient and doesn't impact memory usage

## Documentation Requirements
- Document planning notification types and their content
- Provide configuration examples for planning notifications
- Create troubleshooting guide for planning notification issues
- Document planning statistics and their meanings
- Include examples of notification output for different planning scenarios
