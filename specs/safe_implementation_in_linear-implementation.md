# Spike Implementation: SAFe Implementation in Linear

## Spike Information
- **Spike ID**: SP-2
- **Time-Box**: 2 days
- **Priority**: High

## Question to Answer
How can we best implement SAFe methodology in Linear, specifically mapping SAFe concepts to Linear entities and establishing best practices for the Planning Agent?

## Spike Objective
Research and document the optimal approach for implementing SAFe methodology in Linear, including mapping SAFe concepts (Epics, Features, Stories, Enablers) to Linear entities, establishing naming conventions, labeling strategies, and relationship management. The findings will guide the implementation of the Planning Agent's SAFe capabilities.

## Expected Outcomes
- Detailed mapping of SAFe concepts to Linear entities
- Recommendations for labels, statuses, and relationships in Linear
- Examples of SAFe workflows in Linear
- Guidelines for implementing SAFe hierarchy in the Planning Agent
- Documentation of best practices for maintaining SAFe compliance in Linear

## Technical Context
### Related Codebase Areas
- `src/safe/hierarchy.ts`: Contains SAFe hierarchy management
- `src/safe/pi-planning.ts`: Contains Program Increment planning
- `src/safe/enablers.ts`: Contains Technical Enabler management
- `src/agent/planning.ts`: Contains planning logic

### Background Information
SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) is a set of organization and workflow patterns intended to guide enterprises in scaling lean and agile practices. It provides a structured approach to organizing work at various levels:

- **Epic**: Large initiatives that deliver significant business value
- **Feature**: Specific functionality that delivers business value
- **Story**: Small, independent pieces of work that can be completed in a sprint
- **Enabler**: Technical work that supports future functionality

Linear is a project management tool designed for modern software development teams. It has concepts like:

- **Issues**: The basic unit of work
- **Projects**: Groups of related issues
- **Labels**: Tags that can be applied to issues
- **Cycles**: Time-boxed periods for completing work (similar to sprints)
- **Roadmaps**: Visual representations of planned work over time

The challenge is to map SAFe concepts to Linear entities in a way that maintains SAFe methodology while leveraging Linear's capabilities.

### Current Knowledge Gaps
- How to represent SAFe hierarchy in Linear
- Best practices for labeling and categorizing SAFe work items in Linear
- How to manage relationships between SAFe work items in Linear
- How to implement Program Increments in Linear
- How to track and manage Technical Enablers in Linear
- How to ensure proper allocation of capacity to Technical Enablers (20-30%)

## Investigation Plan
### Research Areas
1. **SAFe Methodology**: Review SAFe documentation to understand core concepts and requirements
2. **Linear API**: Explore Linear API capabilities for creating and managing issues, projects, and relationships
3. **Existing Solutions**: Research existing implementations of SAFe in similar tools
4. **Linear Best Practices**: Identify Linear best practices for organizing work

### Proof of Concept Requirements
- Create a sample SAFe hierarchy in Linear
- Implement relationship management between different levels
- Test labeling and categorization strategies
- Validate that the approach supports all SAFe requirements

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Completeness**: Does the approach support all SAFe concepts?
- **Usability**: Is the approach intuitive and easy to use?
- **Maintainability**: Can the approach be maintained over time?
- **Scalability**: Does the approach scale to large numbers of work items?
- **API Support**: Does the Linear API support all required operations?
