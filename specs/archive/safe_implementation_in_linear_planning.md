- Define next steps for implementation

## Experiments to Conduct

### Experiment 1: SAFe Hierarchy Representation
- Test different approaches for representing SAFe hierarchy in Linear
- Options to test:
  - Using Projects for Epics and Issues for Features/Stories
  - Using parent-child relationships between Issues
  - Using Labels to indicate hierarchy level
- Evaluate each approach against the evaluation criteria

### Experiment 2: Relationship Management
- Test different approaches for managing relationships between SAFe work items
- Options to test:
  - Using Linear's built-in parent-child relationships
  - Using custom fields to store relationships
  - Using descriptions or comments to reference related items
- Evaluate each approach for ease of use and maintainability

### Experiment 3: Labeling and Categorization
- Test different labeling strategies for SAFe work items
- Options to test:
  - Using Labels for SAFe levels (Epic, Feature, Story, Enabler)
  - Using Labels for SAFe categories (Business, Enabler, etc.)
  - Using custom fields for SAFe metadata
- Evaluate each approach for clarity and usability

### Experiment 4: Program Increment Implementation
- Test different approaches for implementing Program Increments
- Options to test:
  - Using Roadmaps for Program Increments
  - Using Projects for Program Increments
  - Using Cycles for Program Increments
- Evaluate each approach for alignment with SAFe methodology

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Completeness**: Does the approach support all SAFe concepts?
- **Usability**: Is the approach intuitive and easy to use?
- **Maintainability**: Can the approach be maintained over time?
- **Scalability**: Does the approach scale to large numbers of work items?
- **API Support**: Does the Linear API support all required operations?
