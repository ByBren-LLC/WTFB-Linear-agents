## File Movement Process

### Moving from Doing
Files are moved here when:
1. **Implementation Complete**: All code written and tested
2. **PR Merged**: Changes successfully integrated to dev branch
3. **Quality Verified**: ARCHitect approval and review completed
4. **Linear Updated**: Issue status updated to "Done"

### Movement Command
```bash
git mv specs/doing/[filename] specs/done/[filename]
git commit -m "complete: finish implementation of [task-name]

Implementation completed and merged
PR: #[PR-NUMBER]
Linear issue: [ISSUE-ID] → Done
Agent: [AGENT-ID]

All acceptance criteria met:
- [Criterion 1] ✅
- [Criterion 2] ✅
- [Criterion 3] ✅

[Agent-ID: AGENT-ID]"
```
