# TypeScript Strict Mode Compliance - 4-Agent Coordination Plan

**Document Type:** Implementation Coordination
**Author:** Auggie III, ARCHitect-in-the-IDE
**Date:** January 27, 2025
**Status:** Active Coordination

## Overview

This document coordinates a 4-agent parallel effort to resolve TypeScript strict mode compliance issues that are blocking all tests. Each agent has an isolated scope to prevent conflicts.

## Agent Assignments

### Agent #1: Jest Mock Type Infrastructure (LIN-39)
- **Branch:** `fix/jest-mock-type-infrastructure`
- **Priority:** CRITICAL - Blocking all tests
- **Scope:** Fix Jest mock type inference issues
- **Files:** All `*.test.ts` files with mock type errors
- **Key Issue:** Jest mock functions being inferred as `never` type

### Agent #2: Linear SDK v2.6.0 Compatibility (LIN-40)
- **Branch:** `fix/linear-sdk-v2-6-0-compatibility`
- **Priority:** HIGH - SDK compatibility
- **Scope:** Update Linear SDK property access patterns
- **Files:** Files using Linear SDK with property access issues
- **Key Issue:** `parentId` vs `parent`, `cycleId` vs `cycle` property access

### Agent #3: SAFe Model Type Completeness (LIN-41)
- **Branch:** `fix/safe-model-type-completeness`
- **Priority:** HIGH - Type safety
- **Scope:** Fix SAFe model type definitions and enum mismatches
- **Files:** SAFe model definitions and related test files
- **Key Issue:** Missing required properties, enum mismatches

### Agent #4: Source Code Property Access (LIN-42)
- **Branch:** `fix/source-code-property-access`
- **Priority:** MEDIUM - Property definitions
- **Scope:** Fix missing property definitions in core source files
- **Files:** Core source files with property access errors
- **Key Issue:** Missing `intervalMinutes` property and similar issues

## Coordination Strategy

### Phase 1: Parallel Development
- All 4 agents work simultaneously on isolated scopes
- No file conflicts expected due to different focus areas
- Each agent creates their own feature branch
- Independent testing and validation

### Phase 2: Integration (ARCHitect-in-the-IDE)
1. **Agent #1 (Jest)** - Merge first (highest priority, blocks testing)
2. **Agent #4 (Properties)** - Merge second (simple, low conflict risk)
3. **Agent #3 (SAFe Models)** - Merge third (type definitions)
4. **Agent #2 (Linear SDK)** - Merge last (most complex, may need adjustments)

### Phase 3: Final Validation
- Full test suite execution
- Build verification
- Integration testing
- Dev to main merge preparation

## Success Criteria

### Individual Agent Success
- [ ] All TypeScript compilation errors resolved in scope
- [ ] Tests pass for affected files
- [ ] No new errors introduced
- [ ] Clean PR with focused changes

### Overall Success
- [ ] All tests pass with TypeScript strict mode
- [ ] Build completes successfully
- [ ] No regression in functionality
- [ ] Ready for dev to main merge

## Risk Mitigation

### Conflict Prevention
- Isolated file scopes minimize merge conflicts
- Clear boundaries between agent responsibilities
- Sequential integration reduces integration risk

### Failure Recovery
- If any agent fails, others continue independently
- ARCHitect-in-the-IDE can take over failed assignments
- Partial success still provides value

### Quality Assurance
- Each PR reviewed before merge
- Integration testing after each merge
- Rollback capability if issues arise

## Communication Protocol

### Agent Reporting
- Create PR when work is complete
- Include test results in PR description
- Tag ARCHitect-in-the-IDE for review

### Coordination Updates
- ARCHitect-in-the-IDE monitors all PRs
- Integration order may adjust based on completion timing
- Status updates in Linear issues

## Expected Timeline

- **Agent Work:** 2-4 hours parallel execution
- **Integration:** 1-2 hours sequential merging
- **Validation:** 30 minutes final testing
- **Total:** 3-6 hours vs 8-12 hours sequential

This coordinated approach transforms a complex sequential task into manageable parallel work with proper SAFe methodology coordination.
